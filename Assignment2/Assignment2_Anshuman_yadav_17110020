theyre building the most incredible things you have ever seen </s>', '<s> they are building airports in qatar--which they like to say cutter but ive always said qatar so ill keep it qatar what the hell </s>', '<s> but theyre building theyre building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen in dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen </s>', '<s> and then i come back to laguardia where the runways have potholes </s>', '<s> the place is falling apart </s>', '<s> you go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor thats so old its falling apart </s>', '<s> and they have a hole in it and they replace it with asphalt </s>', '<s> so you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place </s>', '<s> this is inside not outside </s>', '<s> and i just left dubai where they have the most incredible thing youve ever seen </s>', '<s> in fact my pilot said oh mr trump this is such an honor </s>', '<s> i said its not an honor theyre just smart </s>', '<s> but you look at lax and you look at kennedy airport and you look at our airports generally you look at our roadways where theyre crumbling </s>', '<s> you look at all of the things that are bad-- ill give you an example </s>', '<s> and this isnt part of what i was going to say but i ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails </s>', '<s> you know the guard rails </s>', '<s> the ones that sort of go like this demonstrates with hand that are always bent rusted and horrible </s>', '<s> did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isnt corroded or bent or the heat if it gets too hot it just crushes </s>', '<s> now theyve been selling this thing for 25 years </s>', '<s> why doesnt someone stop them and get something that works </s>', '<s> because they dont know they dont know whats happening </s>', '<s> somebody made a lot of money on that </s>', '<s> they dont know what is happening </s>', '<s> so we have to make our country great again </s>', '<s> we have to rebuild our country </s>', '<s> and we have a long way to go </s>', '<s> we are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money </s>', '<s> now we owe it to the chinese a lot of it </s>', '<s> we owe it to other countries </s>', '<s> theyre the ones that hold the debt </s>', '<s> and then we give them money </s>', '<s> we have countries that we owe money to and yet were giving them subsidies </s>', '<s> i just ordered thousands of television sets and between lg and samsung and i mean you know-- no american company comes to see and comes to bid </s>', '<s> its south korea and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships we send the destroyers we send our airplanes were going to protect them </s>', '<s> what are we doing why arent they paying us </s>', '<s> why arent they paying us what are we doing </s>', '<s> i order thousands and thousands of sets all the time for some reason its south korea </s>', '<s> you know whether its china south korea but in this case televisions south korea </s>', '<s> why arent they doing something to justify what is going on </s>', '<s> now we have a very important election coming up </s>', '<s> we have a presidential election coming up </s>', '<s> and we have some good people </s>', '<s> nobody like trump of course but these are minor details </s>', '<s> we have some good people </s>', '<s> it cant be mitt because mitt ran and failed </s>', '<s> he failed </s>', '<s> i mean i liked him </s>', '<s> look--like him dislike him--the 47 statement that he made thats not going away </s>', '<s> the romneycare from massachusetts thats not going away </s>', '<s> what do you think theyre going to say oh we wont bring that up this time </s>', '<s> its not fair because it was a long t-- that doesnt work </s>', '<s> but more importantly he choked </s>', '<s> something happened to him in the last month </s>', '<s> he had that election won </s>', '<s> and let me tell you something </s>', '<s> that election sort of like a dealmaker that cant close the deal </s>', '<s> i know many of those guys they get it up to the one-yard line they go ah ah i cant close it </s>', '<s> or a golfer that cant sink the three-footer to win the tournament </s>', '<s> and there are many of them </s>', '<s> most people are like that i mean most people are like that </s>', '<s> you cant give somebody another chance cause actually i think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president </s>', '<s> i really do </s>', '<s> i think beating obama would have been a much easier one than the one thats coming up which is sad to say but true </s>', '<s> so you cant have romney </s>', '<s> he choked </s>', '<s> you cant have bush </s>', '<s> the last thing we need is another bush </s>', '<s> now i made that statement very strongly and now every one says the last thing-- you know they copied it </s>', '<s> ill be accused of copying the statement thats the bad thing </s>', '<s> but i said it </s>', '<s> i was the one that said it first and i mean it </s>', '<s> the last thing we need is another bush </s>', '<s> now hes totally in favor of common core thats a disaster thats bad it should be local and all of that </s>', '<s> but hes totally in favor of common core </s>', '<s> hes very very weak on immigration </s>', '<s> dont forget--remember his statement--they come for love </s>', '<s> i say what </s>', '<s> come for love </s>', '<s> youve got these people coming half of them are criminals </s>', '<s> theyre coming for love </s>', '<s> theyre coming for a lot of other reasons and its not love </s>', '<s> and when he runs you got to remember his brother really gave us obama </s>', '<s> i was never a big fan but his brother gave us obama </s>', '<s> cause abraham lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months </s>', '<s> and then he appointed justice roberts </s>', '<s> and jeb wanted justice roberts </s>', '<s> and justice roberts basically approved obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes </s>', '<s> so you cant have jeb bush </s>', '<s> and hes going to lose aside from that hes not going to win </s>', '<s> so mitt and--you just cant have those two </s>', '<s> thats it </s>', '<s> thats it </s>', '<s> its so simple </s>', '<s> so just in summing up and i just wrote a few of these little points down because its very important </s>', '<s> and i watch these teleprompters and by the way i think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter because we got one that uses teleprompters </s>', '<s> and people say oh he is so quick on his feet </s>', '<s> he is reading it </s>', '<s> i mean give me a break </s>', '<s> everything is read </s>', '<s> you dont really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk </s>', '<s> and thats what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters </s>', '<s> but so when i look at these things here i say you know what its so much easier it would be so nice just bah pa bah pa bah bing bing bing </s>', '<s> no problems get off stage everybody falls asleep and thats the end of that </s>', '<s> but we have to do something about these teleprompters </s>', '<s> but in looking at these situations-- i built an incredible company </s>', '<s> and youll see that </s>', '<s> an incredible company a wonderful company </s>', '<s> i employ thousands of people and i love doing what im doing </s>', '<s> and in a certain way i wish i werent doing this but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix </s>', '<s> we have such great potential </s>', '<s> so if i run for president and if i win i would totally succeed in creating jobs defeating isis and stopping the islamic terrorists--and you have to do that reducing the budget deficit--so important have to do it securing our southern border--and i mean seriously securing it stopping nuclear weapons in iran and elsewhere saving social security medicare and medicaid without cutting it down to the bone because its not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and its not fair to future people coming up and we can do it repealing obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people and far less expensive both for the people and for the country </s>', '<s> and believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody </s>', '<s> and everybody can be covered </s>', '<s> im not saying leave 50-percent of the people out </s>', '<s> everybody can be c-- this plan is just a basic disaster </s>', '<s> nobody knows </s>', '<s> as bad as the website was this is how bad the plan itself is fixing our countrys infrastructure our bridges our schools our highways our airports </s>', '<s> and that i can tell you nobody is close to trump </s>', '<s> i just got the best hotel in north america </s>', '<s> im building which is sort of interesting think of this one </s>', '<s> im building one of the great hotels of the world on pennsylvania avenue right opposite the white house between the white house and congress </s>', '<s> right on penn-- the old post office site and i got it from obama </s>', '<s> do you believe that </s>', '<s> and everybody wanted it </s>', '<s> so i cant believe it myself </s>', '<s> but its going to be fantastic and so many other things </s>', '<s> i know what needs to be done to make america great again </s>', '<s> we can make this country great again </s>', '<s> the potential is enormous </s>', '<s> and i am serious thinking of running for president because i can do the job </s>', '<s> thank you all very much </s>', '<s> thank you

'<s> they’re the ones that caused it </s>', '<s> they go into libya </s>', '<s> they knocked the hell out of gadhafi </s>', '<s> ok so gadhafi — they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people </s>', '<s> you know the ambassador was riding in a jeep one of our jeeps of course a military jeep holding the libyan flag and you know freedom freedom freedom </s>', '<s> and then gets killed by the same people </s>', '<s> so we backed people that turned out to be far worse than gadhafi </s>', '<s> look at what we did in iraq </s>', '<s> look at what we did in iraq </s>', '<s> i mean what the hell did we get </s>', '<s> we spent 2 trillion and that was as a year and a half ago </s>', '<s> i keep saying two or three it’s a lot more than that </s>', '<s> we spent 2 trillion we have thousands of deaths and i’m not even talking other side </s>', '<s> you are talking about hundreds of thousands maybe millions </s>', '<s> you have thousands of deaths </s>', '<s> we have wounded warriors who i love all of </s>', '<s> these guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people </s>', '<s> you know these are the greatest people </s>', '<s> and then what happens </s>', '<s> we leave and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving </s>', '<s> so i said man if i’m the enemy i’m just going to go wait for 18 months right </s>', '<s> he gave a date </s>', '<s> we are leaving iraq we will be gone by such and such a time </s>', '<s> i said i’m just sitting there watching and i’m saying man that’s really stupid </s>', '<s> because believe me the enemy doesn’t want to be killed </s>', '<s> you know you hear so much oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go right </s>', '<s> they don’t </s>', '<s> they want to live </s>', '<s> and they want to take care of their families always their families </s>', '<s> you remember that because their families know what’s going on ok </s>', '<s> you think their wives don’t know what

know exactly what’s going on </s>', '<s> remember that </s>', '<s> and frankly i think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives ok </s>', '<s> but they still want to live </s>', '<s> so here is obama gives an exact date </s>', '<s> he gives an exact date and so they pull back </s>', '<s> and everyone says oh we are doing so well </s>', '<s> look we’re doing so well </s>', '<s> why should they fight when they know in 18 months they can go in and take the place </s>', '<s> so what happens </s>', '<s> so we have isis taking a lot of oil </s>', '<s> i said take the oil </s>', '<s> remember when we left i was opposed to going in because i said you’re going to destabilize the middle east </s>', '<s> because you had iraq and you had iran </s>', '<s> and i said

</s>', '<s> and they were stabilized </s>', '<s> and i said if you go after one or the other in this case iraq you’re going to destabilize the middle east </s>', '<s> that’s what going to happen </s>', '<s> you’re going to destabilize the middle east </s>', '<s> and that’s exactly what happened </s>', '<s> we totally destabilized the middle east </s>', '<s> we have now migrations largely

went out </s>', '<s> and we shouldn’t have given dates </s>', '<s> i mean i would have probably said we are going to stay forever </s>', '<s> and they would have said oh man </s>', '<s> and then keep going keep going and eventually they would get tired and say this guy is crazy </s>', '<s> i mean he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal </s>', '<s> but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said they just pull back </s>', '<s> and then as soon as we left they come in ok </s>', '<s> so they have the oil </s>', '<s> you know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right </s>', '<s> china </s>', '<s> always china </s>', '<s> i love china </s>', '<s> i love mexico </s>', '<s> their leaders are too smart for us </s>', '<s> we have no border </s>', '<s>

you know we are bombing </s>', '<s> great </s>', '<s> what’s going to happen after that </s>', '<s> so we’re bombing </s>', '<s> and you know we are not really bombing it because they are still selling it </s>', '<s> i said how could they keep selling it </s>', '<s> obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere </s>', '<s> no this is serious </s>', '<s> now think of it </s>', '<s> he talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old air force one an old boeing 747 with the old engines and you know spewing stuff

iowa is so important to me </s>', '<s> i could say oh let’s not do – i am an evangelical </s>', '<s> i am a christian </s>', '<s> i’m a presbyterian </s>', '<s> i’m a presbyterian </s>', '<s> i love

'<s> you know when i was using iowa they lied so much </s>', '<s> i said the people of iowa can’t be that stupid or the people of the country can’t – </s>', '<s> i’m trying to make a point right

rubio doing </s>', '<s> not good </s>', '<s> i mean it seems like a two-person race right nowand it’s an important race to me </s>', '<s> so i just want to let you know it’s very important </s>', '<s> so with all of that if we win iowa a lot of people say we’d just go through </s>', '<s> i think we’ll win virtually every state in the union and it’s over quickly </s>', '<s> over quickly </s>', '<s> what about the republican establishment </s>', '<s> the establishment’s got a problem you know </s>', '<s> it’s sort of like the fighters </s>', '<s> you know the great champions </s>', '<s> sometimes

</s>', '<s> it’s a very dangerous terrible thing </s>', '<s> so we will change our laws because you really have no choice </s>', '<s> it’s so out of control </s>', '<s> it’s so terrible </s>', '<s> but the papers that are in this room tonight they should look at this </s>', '<s> there’s so little money left over for the candidates it’s one of the reasons why i’m so happy i’m doing my own </s>', '<s> we actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 pacs </s>', '<s> the trump pac the trump pac the this pac </s>', '<s> first of all i’m sure that out of some of them they stole the money

don’t do it </s>', '<s> we don’t want it </s>', '<s> and we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you </s>', '<s> but the super pac concept is corrupt </s>', '<s> it’s

zero </s>', '<s> many of them zero </s>', '<s> and so finally i said look let’s – we’re going to do it </s>', '<s> we have to do it </s>', '<s> just too many things that i watch on television with our

have to do it </s>', '<s> now we’re going to have to do it </s>', '<s> and i look at it last time with romney and i didn’t do it and i probably should have because he let us down </s>', '<s> i mean

takes – because you have to vet each company </s>', '<s> you know much of this money was paid out fairly early </s>', '<s> but you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many

1 million but i just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did </s>', '<s> one other thing that’s important to know </s>', '<s> zero dollars have been taken out for administration </s>', '<s> you know when you go to a lot of these different groups in this case zero dollars have been taken out for administration </s>', '<s> so a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff </s>', '<s> so no money – it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> so you have 22 kill and that’s 200000

to mention anybody specifically but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting </s>', '<s> they’d call and these vet groups they don’t get a lot of calls from the press </s>', '<s> and maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn’t know or they didn’t want to talk to the press or they didn’t feel comfortable </s>', '<s> so if they didn’t say they got the money which they all did 100 got the money </s>', '<s> all certified checks </s>', '<s> if anyone wants to see the certified checks </s>', '<s> but rather than say why don’t you – could i see a certified check </s>', '<s> they said well they didn’t say they got the money </s>', '<s> they all got the money </s>', '<s> but they’re not people that always talk to the press </s>', '<s> many of them do talk to the press </s>', '<s> many of them have – i guess you found 2 million or 25 million where they talked </s>', '<s> well the number is 56 million and it’s going to possibly go above that because i believe some other people are coming in </s>', '<s> ready </s>', '<s> 22kill got 200000 </s>', '<s> now these are checks that have been delivered that have been cashed that are now being used to help the vets

living – 100000 </s>', '<s> america’s vetdogs – the veterans’ k-9 corps inc – 75000 </s>', '<s> amvets – 75000 </s>', '<s> just so you understand </s>', '<s> when i didn’t do the fox debatebecause i didn’t think they treated me right but actually they’ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months i have to say that about fox </s>', '<s> but when i didn’t do that one event the debate i gave a speech </s>', '<s> i didn’t have to do this with the money for the vets but i decided to because i thought it would be a good idea </s>', '<s> and i had some very generous people – carl icahn gave 500000 </s>', '<s> phil ruffin gave 1 millionike perlmutter gave 1 million </s>', '<s> we raised a lot of money </s>', '<s> and i didn’t have to do that </s>', '<s> it would have been easier just to give the speech </s>', '<s> and the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it not to give money to different things because it’s a lot easier actually that way </s>', '<s> and i believe we’re going to have some more coming in </s>', '<s> some friends of mine some more coming in </s>', '<s> and that adds up to 5600000 total and we’re going to have some more coming in </s>', '<s> now every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they’re getting a final approval from the government </s>', '<s> but every one of those has been passed </s>', '<s> this is my check for 1 million </s>', '<s> we have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn’t ask – i didn’t ask people to be here today </s>', '<s> i could have asked every one of the group unlike hillary who asks people to stand outside and say donald trump didn’t give the money </s>', '<s> nobody gave this kind of money </s>', '<s> so i gave 5600000 </s>', '<s> more is coming in </s>', '<s> probably tops the 6 million number </s>', '<s> i never thought we were going to raise 1 million when we started </s>', '<s> and we end up doing almost 6 million </s>', '<s> i have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair </s>', '<s> a lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money </s>', '<s> and i just want to thank all of those people </s>', '<s> i wasn’t too involved in picking the organizations other than to the marine law enforcement </s>', '<s> they are fabulous people </s>', '<s> they honored me last year at the waldorf astoria </s>', '<s> i knew them </s>', '<s> i was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn’t vet them quickly </s>', '<s> and so i gave it to the marine </s>', '<s> and if you look at number the marine corps law enforcement foundation is a fabulous group and i didn’t have to go through a big vetting process with them </s>', '<s> because i was going to split the 1 million check up amongstand in the end i just didn’t want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups </s>', '<s> because i wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart </s>', '<s> i didn’t want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going where did it go </s>', '<s> who did it go to </s>', '<s> then we said who it went to then we said how much was it </s>', '<s> look when this startedi said if we could raise 1 million that would be good </s>', '<s> and we ended up raising almost 6 million </s>', '<s> and i’m going to have more coming in over a period of time </s>', '<s> i’m totally accountable but i didn’t want to have credit for it </s>', '<s> actually though what i got was worse than credit because they were questioning me </s>', '<s> and this is money </s>', '<s> and by the way most of that money went out very early just so you understand </s>', '<s> but a lot of these groups – getting vetted by you know when you pay the money out they need government documentation </s>', '<s> they need a lot of different things </s>', '<s> plus we want to find out who’s in the good group </s>', '<s> i had people – teams of people – reviewing statistics reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money </s>', '<s> we have given to groups that are unbelievable groups </s>', '<s> and honestly i wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters </s>', '<s> they are so happy </s>', '<s> and i’m happy to do it </s>', '<s> i didn’t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly </s>', '<s> well generally speaking that’s 100 true </s>', '<s> i like scrutiny </s>', '<s> but you know what </s>', '<s> when i raise money – excuse me excuse me i’ve watched you on television </s>', '<s> you’re a real beauty </s>', '<s> when i raise money for the veterans and it’s a massive amount of money – find out how much hillary clinton has given to the veterans – nothing </s>', '<s> and then i see a few guys standing out there </s>', '<s> they don’t even know what they’re there for </s>', '<s> they have no idea </s>', '<s> they’re there because hillary clinton’s campaign sent them </s>', '<s> and actually i think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with hillary clinton’s campaign which was interesting but i wasn’t surprised </s>', '<s> i don’t want the credit for it

else am i going to raise the money </s>', '<s> how else am i going to raise the money </s>', '<s> i would have given – just so you understand </s>', '<s> until i was criticized – so i’m the only one

but more money is coming through than didn’t come through </s>', '<s> the number probably is going to be – when we finish it probably going to be over the 6 million </s>', '<s> i don’t mind it coming

lot of people </s>', '<s> i don’t know – 10000 15000 maybe 25000 </s>', '<s> i don’t know there was a lot of people </s>', '<s> plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along </s>', '<s>

i’m probably 40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly i haven’t had to spend very much although i guess we just did a recent filing and i would be probably having spent now maybe 14 million 15 million </s>', '<s> but i’m self-funding </s>', '<s> and i must tell you i don’t know that enough people appreciate it </s>', '<s> i’m self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not

the voters </s>', '<s> i’m the only one on both sides that’s self funding </s>', '<s> i’m putting up my own money </s>', '<s> and i don’t know that the voters appreciate it </s>', '<s> when they go

'<s> it’s a very big thing </s>', '<s> it’s a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisionsor looking for themselves or looking for the

exact same thing </s>', '<s> and the reason is – you know why </s>', '<s> because i raised 6 million for the vets in one hour </s>', '<s> so if i took a second place instead of a first place and could

finish first </s>', '<s> i’d like to finish first </s>', '<s> just so you understand </s>', '<s> i am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations

pretty good week </s>', '<s> the debate last week – everybody watched the debate </s>', '<s> and who knew about these debates </s>', '<s> i didn’t know anything about the debates </s>', '<s> and it’s been fun and it’s been interesting </s>', '<s> and i’ve been treated semi-fairly by the moderators </s>', '<s> not 100 </s>', '<s> some have been very fair actually and some have been not so fair

a lot of them – it’s like the academy awards </s>', '<s> but we’ve had an amazing – it’s been an amazing experience and it started really on june 16th when we came down the escalator </s>', '<s> we came down that escalator and it was – i said let’s go to my wife who’s been so supportive and so wonderful </s>', '<s> i said let’s go </s>', '<s> we’re going to make america great again </s>', '<s> that’s what we’re going to do </s>', '<s> and you know it’s hard to do this because when you think of it i’ve never done it before </s>', '<s> i’ve never been a politician </s>', '<s> thank goodness

going to run for president i gave up a lot </s>', '<s> you know gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at nbc no more apprentice </s>', '<s> that’s hard to do </s>', '<s> you have a top show and you say i’m not doing it anymore </s>', '<s> i’m sorry </s>', '<s> they wanted to do it so badly </s>', '<s> and steve burke who’s a fantastic executive came up to my office and

sure </s>', '<s> you know that was about two months before </s>', '<s> i was pretty sure </s>', '<s> it really is a tough thing to do </s>', '<s> you know all my life i’ve heard if you’re a very successful person you’ll never run for president </s>', '<s> you’ll never really run for politics </s>', '<s> but you’ll never ever run for president </s>', '<s> and i built a great company and it’s a tremendous number </s>', '<s> you saw the filings </s>', '<s> the press was going to look so closely </s>', '<s> it was like d-day when we put those papers in </s>', '<s> you know first thing i did i announced </s>', '<s> they said oh he’s actually going to do it because most of them said he’ll never do it </s>', '<s> then when i signedthat’s when you sign your life away </s>', '<s> and i signed that </s>', '<s> they said whoa </s>', '<s> he signed that </s>', '<s> well he’ll never file his financials because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks </s>', '<s> and i filed the financials

report ever filed with the fec in terms of that </s>', '<s> and it showed a company that’s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets very little debt tremendous cash flow </s>', '<s> you know the way it’s supposed to be </s>', '<s> and it’s great </s>', '<s> and the reason i tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the united states </s>', '<s> we need that kind of thinking </s>', '<s> we need that – whatever it is </s>', '<s> we need a mentality that’s going to – you know we’re at 19 trillion in debt </s>', '<s> it’s going to be up to 21 trillion </s>', '<s> you saw that horrible budget </s>', '<s> horrible horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that’s going to lift it </s>', '<s> and so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which i love and new ones came out today and i’ll tell you right now </s>', '<s> you know now that we’re at it </s>', '<s> and they came out some brand new ones – some beauties </s>', '<s> and one’s coming out – i guess a big one’s coming out </s>', '<s> i don’t know exactly what it is but it’s got to be pretty good because i see the response </s>', '<s> i mean even this with all the people still trying to come into this building </s>', '<s> somebody said it’s a barn </s>', '<s> this is a very nice barn actually </s>', '<s> but with all of the people still trying to come in you see what it is </s>', '<s> and we do have something special in a couple of minutes </s>', '<s> to me it’s really special because it’s a person that i think is a spectacular person </s>', '<s> so it’s very special to me </s>', '<s> but then the polls came out and some of them – as an example – national polls 38 for trump 20 for second </s>', '<s> i wouldn’t even names </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> i won’t even mention names </s>', '<s> i’m going to be non-confrontational today for a change </s>', '<s> 21 for the second </s>', '<s> 11 </s>', '<s> and then they’re all down </s>', '<s> some of them are actually at 0 and 1 </s>', '<s> i don’t know </s>', '<s> jeb – well you know jeb’s got one problem </s>', '<s> he loves common core meaning he wants your kids educated from washington which is immediately no good </s>', '<s> and his second problem is he’s very weak on illegal immigration </s>', '<s> remember he said they come as an act of love </s>', '<s> i said what </s>', '<s> they come as an act of love </s>', '<s> so i think those are two very bad points frankly </s>', '<s> so south carolina just came out and that’s 32 for trump 18 for second 11 for third </s>', '<s> great </s>', '<s> florida leading by a lot – 31 19 13 and then all down in the dumps </s>', '<s> georgia just came out </s>', '<s> i have 33 </s>', '<s> yeah don’t forget that’s 33 </s>', '<s> hard to believe </s>', '<s> that’s with 14 people 15 people </s>', '<s> i don’t know when they took it but it was recent </s>', '<s> 33 </s>', '<s> connecticut – now tom brady loves me and that’s sort of like you know and i love tom brady by the way </s>', '<s> 35 to 18 to 9 to 2 </s>', '<s> you know to nothing </s>', '<s> maryland just came out </s>', '<s> maryland – great place – 32 to 15 to 11 to 9 and then you know they sort of phase out </s>', '<s> you ever hear of a place called iowa </s>', '<s> oh i love this </s>', '<s> we’re doing actually great </s>', '<s> first of all i have to tell you </s>', '<s> you know they never report it </s>', '<s> even cnn doesn’t report it </s>', '<s> cnn does a poll probably spent millions they never report their poll </s>', '<s> the cnn poll was 33 for trump 20 for chris </s>', '<s> nobody talks about it </s>', '<s> nobody talks about it </s>', '<s> they don’t talk about it </s>', '<s> they talk about – cnn is reporting other people’s polls </s>', '<s> so i call up </s>', '<s> i say wait a minute </s>', '<s> you’re cnn </s>', '<s> you spent a fortune on polls and you don’t report your own polls because i’m winning by a lot </s>', '<s> and they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls </s>', '<s> but we’re doing well </s>', '<s> i think we’re doing a lot better than anyone knows </s>', '<s> gravis just came out – 34 for trump 28 for cruz </s>', '<s> ppp 28 for trump 26 for cruz </s>', '<s> in other words it’s a little close here </s>', '<s> quinnipiac poll – very respected 31 for trump 29 for cruz </s>', '<s> and then again cnn 33 to 20 </s>', '<s> so we’re – i think we’re doing good </s>', '<s> i think we’re actually doing better than the polls </s>', '<s> now i could do this </s>', '<s> i could say well i just want to do well in iowa </s>', '<s> i want to win iowa folks </s>', '<s> because look i love the people </s>', '<s> the evangelicals have been phenomenal </s>', '<s> i’m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide i’m winning with evangelical – i don’t know if you know that – by a lot nationwide </s>', '<s> with iowa i’m doing really well with the evangelicals </s>', '<s> we’re doing really well with the tea party </s>', '<s> we’re doing well – i mean you hear the numbers </s>', '<s> i mean these are the numbers </s>', '<s> but i actually think we’re doing even better than the polls </s>', '<s> and you know there’s the thing that a lot of people said you know they call up are you going to vote for trump </s>', '<s> he’s got very very tough immigration policies </s>', '<s> he wants to destroy obamacare and replace it with something a lot better </s>', '<s> i’m going to do that </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> but you know a lot of people they’ll pick up the phone and they’ll hear different things and they’ll say uh no i’ll vote for – and then they’d get in the booth and they say trump is my man </s>', '<s> there are a lot of people saying that we’re going to do a lot better </s>', '<s> but we’ll see because feb 1st you have to get to caucus you have to go out </s>', '<s> you’ve got to do it </s>', '<s> otherwise we’ve all wasted our time </s>', '<s> you know one of the groups in maine and it was like incredible </s>', '<s> we were in different places up in new england recently and new hampshire was amazing </s>', '<s> and the people are standing there </s>', '<s> it was so cold </s>', '<s> there was one little group of – despite global warming – you know you hear about it was so cold </s>', '<s> it was windchill below zero </s>', '<s> and people were standing outside for hours trying to get in </s>', '<s> and then you hear the announcers </s>', '<s> well will they show up to vote </s>', '<s> and i don’t know much but i say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn’t believe in tennessee in texas where we had 21000 people no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they’ll stand for hours and hours to get in </s>', '<s> why aren’t they going to go and vote </s>', '<s> or in your case caucus </s>', '<s> why aren’t they going to go and vote </s>', '<s> it’s sort of an amazing thing </s>', '<s> so we think they’re going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote </s>', '<s> now yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different </s>', '<s> it’s a very interesting system </s>', '<s> but it is different </s>', '<s> here’s what i have to say about iowa </s>', '<s> it’s very important </s>', '<s> so you know there’s a movement to move iowa to the back of the pack </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> you know that </s>', '<s> you’ll still see me but you won’t see other people </s>', '<s> believe me </s>', '<s> i’m loyal </s>', '<s> to a fault i’m loyal </s>', '<s> but you’re going to see </s>', '<s> i give you

trademarked because we’re smart </s>', '<s> a couple of them got up </s>', '<s> no you see i was making this speech and everybody stood up – make america great again… but nobody stood up to them </s>', '<s> but we sent them a little notice – don’t use that term </s>', '<s> we’re trademarked </s>', '<s> can you imagine i got the approval </s>', '<s> but we are – we’re building a great hotel down the road </s>', '<s> i hope you all stay and it’s going to be wonderful… …so i was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from ap and they did a very good job </s>', '<s> very fair story </s>', '<s> and one of the questions was about israel and the palestinians what’s going to happen </s>', '<s> i said – i used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make…can we think of any deals </s>', '<s> we all have tough deals right </s>', '<s> you know we have some good some bad… but i said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other </s>', '<s> i believe – because i’m a dealmaker – i believe that i can put both sides together </s>', '<s> but i said it’ll take six months </s>', '<s> at the end of six months and maybe sooner – with us we have a deal instinct </s>', '<s> a lot of us </s>', '<s> and you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you’re going to make a deal </s>', '<s> i will know very quickly whether or not i’ll be able to put that deal together </s>', '<s> i used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together </s>', '<s> there’s probably no tougher deal </s>', '<s> if i could do that it would make me so happy because there’s so much violence so much death and just been going on for so many years </s>', '<s> now i said you have to have a commitment to make it </s>', '<s> i don’t know that israel has the commitment to make it and i don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it </s>', '<s> with that being said you know i have a good chance of winning because you look at what’s going on </s>', '<s> so i have a good chance </s>', '<s> i don’t like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how i feel about this or that </s>', '<s> i’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room </s>', '<s> i don’t want one side or the other saying </s>', '<s> look i think people know where i stand </s>', '<s> but wouldn’t it be great if they could make a deal </s>', '<s> but a lasting deal a real deal </s>', '<s> not a phony deal that’s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again </s>', '<s> i’d love to – and i will give it </s>', '<s> you know obama as you know he said it won’t happen meaning he gave up on this before it even started </s>', '<s> but i think it would be a great thing for israel – i think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made and i’m going to give it my best </s>', '<s> i’m a great dealmaker </s>', '<s> that’s what i do </s>', '<s> i made a lot of money </s>', '<s> i’m going to give it my best </s>', '<s> it would be great if that deal could be made </s>', '<s> … by the way israel has given a lot…and a lot of people don’t know that </s>', '<s> i think the public relations for israel hasn’t been so great because israel’s given a lot but hasn’t been given a lot of credit for what they’ve given… in fact some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in israel </s>', '<s> there were things given </s>', '<s> but i’d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let’s go everybody’s even we love everybody and let’s see if we could do something </s>', '<s> but i do think this – and i do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons i’m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that israel has given a lot </s>', '<s> i don’t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that’s going to be up to them </s>', '<s> but israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they’ve done </s>', '<s> i will say that </s>', '<s> i will say that </s>', '<s> so that’s it </s>', '<s> you know what i want to do </s>', '<s> i want to wait until i meet with bibi </s>', '<s> you know i’m leaving for israel in a very short period of time </s>', '<s> i know </s>', '<s> i know what you’re saying </s>', '<s> i just – you’re not going to be – who’s the wise guy </s>', '<s> do me a favor </s>', '<s> just relax </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> you’ll like me very much believe me </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> and you wonder why you get yourself in trouble </s>', '<s> all right </s>', '<s> you’re going to like me very much </s>', '<s> it’s going to be fine </s>', '<s> but again you can’t go in with that – if you’re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal – you can’t go in with the attitude we’re going to shove it down </s>', '<s> you’ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone’s happy </s>', '<s> don’t worry about it </s>', '<s> you’re going to be very happy </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> don’t worry about it </s>', '<s> i think he’s a very good man </s>', '<s> i think he’s been treated very badly </s>', '<s> i think that our president has been unbelievably rude to bibi </s>', '<s> i don’t know how many people like bibi </s>', '<s> but i think he’s been unbelievably rude </s>', '<s> and – i mean we’ll talk about deals after the fact which is a shame but i think the iran deal is the worst single thing </s>', '<s> perhaps it’ll go down – and i’ve been pretty good at predicting things </s>', '<s> i think it’s going to go down as the worst single thing that’s ever happened to israel </s>', '<s> i think it’s a catastrophe for israel </s>', '<s> and i think the fact that obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves israel to support this guy or even the democratic party is impossible to believe </s>', '<s> i think it will be one of the great catastrophes </s>', '<s> but if i get in i will straighten it out believe me </s>', '<s> it’s going to be straightened out </s>', '<s> it’s going to be straightened out tough and it’s going to be straightened out fast </s>', '<s> the one bad thing is if i get in the 150 billion is gone </s>', '<s> that hurts me and that hurts the people of israel </s>', '<s> but the 150 billion is gone because it’ll be gone before you get there </s>', '<s> you know we’re talking about a year and more actually </s>', '<s> although the election very quick </s>', '<s> you know it’s coming up </s>', '<s> it’s now less than a year and you know we have the iowa starts on february 1st and then we go right down the line and it’s very exciting </s>', '<s> we’re talking about a couple of months now for it to start </s>', '<s> for a person like me i mean it’s very exciting </s>', '<s> well i haven’t been working too much with the arab leaders to be honest with you </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> you know i told you i made commercials for bibi </s>', '<s> i don’t know if that’s going to help me in the negotiation </s>', '<s> i can tell you </s>', '<s> you know i’m trying to keep it nice and level right </s>', '<s> then i get people screaming at me </s>', '<s> but i’m trying to keep it as level as possible but i for the most part don’t know </s>', '<s> the king of jordan seems like a nice man </s>', '<s> i mean i don’t know </s>', '<s> we’re going to see </s>', '<s> a lot of people like him some people don’t </s>', '<s> but i think i will probably be able – what my history – you know i took some heat because i get along with democrats i get along with liberals i get along with conservatives i get along with republicans </s>', '<s> i get along with everybody </s>', '<s> that’s what i was – i’m a businessperson </s>', '<s> i get along with everybody </s>', '<s> we have to get along with everybody </s>', '<s> and i took some heat and i always explained that </s>', '<s> i said wait a minute i’m a businessperson </s>', '<s> i’ve got to get along with everybody </s>', '<s> i live in manhattan </s>', '<s> it’s all democrat </s>', '<s> i mean it’s virtually all – republicans don’t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5 </s>', '<s> you know they get a very small percentage of the vote </s>', '<s> got to get along with everybody </s>', '<s> i think that’s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in washington </s>', '<s> we have people that – they don’t talk </s>', '<s> you know i remember that years ago because i’ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political </s>', '<s> but years ago the republicans and the democrats – they used to like each other </s>', '<s> they’d get along </s>', '<s> they’d have dinner together </s>', '<s> they’d argue and they’d fight and they’d disagree and would have you know different views and things </s>', '<s> but in the evening they’d go out and they’d have dinner together with their families </s>', '<s> you don’t see that anymore </s>', '<s> there’s total hatred and there’s total gridlock </s>', '<s> i’ll give you one point which i think is important </s>', '<s> corporate inversions </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> so you have companies leaving the united states and they’re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things </s>', '<s> a lot of things are better </s>', '<s> but they’re leaving </s>', '<s> pfizer </s>', '<s> how good is pfizer </s>', '<s> thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost </s>', '<s> but they’re also leaving because we have 25 trillion at least – i think it’s a much higher number than that </s>', '<s> 25 trillion – that’s out of the country that these companies can’t get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high </s>', '<s> they’re so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out </s>', '<s> so they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that’s how much money </s>', '<s> the republicans and the democrats totally agree that the money should come back </s>', '<s> for three years they can’t get a deal </s>', '<s> there’s no leadership </s>', '<s> it’s gridlock </s>', '<s> there’s an example of something where everybody agrees – all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can’t get it done because they’re politicians </s>', '<s> they’re all talk they’re no action </s>', '<s> so there’s something and it’s so important </s>', '<s> it’s not like something where they don’t get – like there’s big disputes and we understand that </s>', '<s> this is something everybody agrees – the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things – taxes paid </s>', '<s> but they agree and they can’t get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership </s>', '<s> you know honestly i don’t think anybody can say </s>', '<s> she says she is </s>', '<s> but now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because she’s going very very far over to the other side </s>', '<s> i mean bernie sanders has brought her to positions that she didn’t want to be at </s>', '<s> you look at some of the things that she’s saying right now </s>', '<s> but i’ll tell you what whether she is or not she doesn’t have the strength or the energy to help israel </s>', '<s> i’m telling you she doesn’t </s>', '<s> …but just take a look </s>', '<s> she’ll come out and do an event and you don’t see her for another four days three days five days </s>', '<s> no it’s true </s>', '<s> think of it </s>', '<s> we don’t need – some people say it’s not nice to say </s>', '<s> she doesn’t have the strength or the energy </s>', '<s> israel needs more than just our support </s>', '<s> they need strength </s>', '<s> they need real power behind them </s>', '<s> because you know you look at as these countries fall over there israel’s looking more and more – you know israel has some difficulties </s>', '<s> and one thing and i think you’ll all admit it </s>', '<s> these people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> we used to think oh that was easy </s>', '<s> 15 years ago with my friends from israel because i have a lot of friends from israel they used to smile and laugh oh don’t worry about it </s>', '<s> now they’re saying these guys are – they’re dirty fighters </s>', '<s> and they’re not bad </s>', '<s> you know they’re tough </s>', '<s> they’re not the jv </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> obama said they’re the jv </s>', '<s> they’re not the jv folks </s>', '<s> we need tough </s>', '<s> we need general george patton </s>', '<s> we need general macarthur </s>', '<s> we don’t need the guys we have </s>', '<s> i see them on television – generals </s>', '<s> i don’t want my generals on television saying well isis is very tough </s>', '<s> i saw a guy the other day </s>', '<s> isis is very tough </s>', '<s> i don’t know </s>', '<s> i don’t need that </s>', '<s> do you think general george patton – they don’t like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy </s>', '<s> so he would never make it </s>', '<s> they probably would have had him thrown out years ago </s>', '<s> but we need patton </s>', '<s> we need a genius like macarthur </s>', '<s> and we have those people </s>', '<s> we have those people </s>', '<s> i’ll find that person </s>', '<s> but we’re going to knock the crap out of them i’ll tell you what </s>', '<s> we’re going to win </s>', '<s> we’re going to win </s>', '<s> we’re going to win </s>', '<s> well i think radical islam right now is and i feel that’s the greatest </s>', '<s> and again we have a president who refuses to use the term </s>', '<s> but radical islam is – i’ll tell you one thing i know isn’t is global warming </s>', '<s> that’s the one thing…i know isn’t </s>', '<s> i mean we have a guy that just the other day who said – here they want to blow everything – this is right after paris </s>', '<s> they want to blow our cities up </s>', '<s> they want to destroy our civilization and he’s worried about global warming which a lot of people think is a hoax </s>', '<s> by the way i won so many environmental awards shockingly </s>', '<s> no it’s true </s>', '<s> and you know what i want to do </s>', '<s> i want really immaculate air </s>', '<s> i want clean crystal water </s>', '<s> i want a lot of things </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> i want a lot of things </s>', '<s> but global warming – you noticed they changed the name – they go global warming they go climate change they go – now i hear a lot of extreme weather </s>', '<s> how can you miss with extreme weather right </s>', '<s> if it’s cold it’s okay </s>', '<s> if it’s hot it’s okay </s>', '<s> if it’s windy if it’s hot – everything is extreme </s>', '<s> so now they use extreme weather </s>', '<s> it is a disgrace what’s going on </s>', '<s> and to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left </s>', '<s> thank you </s>', '<s> thank you very much everybody </s>', '<s> …it’s a great honor </s>', '<s> i want to thank simon and schuster one of the most magnificent publishers </s>', '<s> for years and years i’ve heard about simon and schuster’s being a fabulous – i was going to say the rolls-royce i was going to say the harvard or the yale but they really are a great one </s>', '<s> and i want to thank you very much </s>', '<s> you’ve given us such tremendous support </s>', '<s> and we did this quickly and i think we did it very effectively </s>', '<s> it’s been an incredible experience </s>', '<s> we wrote a book and the title – crippled america – is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and i think one of the reasons we’ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is </s>', '<s> we tell the truth </s>', '<s> and america is crippled </s>', '<s> we owe 17 trillion and now 18 trillion and now it’s actually very soon going to be 19 trillion in debt </s>', '<s> we have a military that doesn’t have proper instruction from leadership </s>', '<s> we don’t know what we’re doing </s>', '<s> we’re losing all over the world with trade deals </s>', '<s> every country no matter what country you talk about you can just pick a name out of a hat they’re beating us in trade </s>', '<s> and we can’t go on like this any longer </s>', '<s> it’s impossible to go on like this any longer </s>', '<s> i always mention as an example sergeant bergdahl a traitor </s>', '<s> we get sergeant bergdahl they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly </s>', '<s> and that’s not the way it’s going to work anymore </s>', '<s> so we write about it in the book </s>', '<s> we tell lots of different stories of lots of different things </s>', '<s> and i think it’s going to be very instructional very important </s>', '<s> to me it was instructional </s>', '<s> when i did the art of the deal i think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional </s>', '<s> even today when i speak so many people hold up the book the art of the deal and the other books we’ve done </s>', '<s> so this is one that probably not since the art of the deal i have to tell this to louise and simon and schuster have i worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time </s>', '<s> we wanted to get it out really really quickly so that it pertain to what’s going on right now </s>', '<s> it’s a moment of time </s>', '<s> and we got it done </s>', '<s> and david did a fantastic job…and all of my people did a great job </s>', '<s> they helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now </s>', '<s> so this was not easy getting this in </s>', '<s> but we see by the lines – the lines go down to park avenue </s>', '<s> they’ve been forming since last night and i’m going to be signing books starting at 12 pm we’re doing a couple of interviews and then we’re signing books starting at 12 pm and that’ll be very exciting for me </s>', '<s> but we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours </s>', '<s> i don’t know how they’re doing this but they do it </s>', '<s> they find a way </s>', '<s> so i’m looking forward to getting to the signings </s>', '<s> … well i think it’s a different book </s>', '<s> you know we just had polls come out today from iowa where i’m leading </s>', '<s> you saw the new poll from iowa </s>', '<s> you saw the new poll in new hampshire where i’m leading big </s>', '<s> a poll just came out in florida where i’m leading big </s>', '<s> georgia texas </s>', '<s> i mean all over the place </s>', '<s> and i think you know look we’re doing well </s>', '<s> and if you add ben and myself we’re beating everybody by a lot </s>', '<s> that seems to be the big story that we’re beating – they call it the establishment </s>', '<s> it’s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down </s>', '<s> but i don’t know </s>', '<s> i don’t know how his book is doing </s>', '<s> well i think my book is very hard-hitting </s>', '<s> his is a different kind of book and he’s a different kind of a person </s>', '<s> my book is very hard-hitting </s>', '<s> it says it like it is </s>', '<s> and based on what simon and schusters just told me it’s selling like hotcakes </s>', '<s> so we’ll see </s>', '<s> we’re very different people </s>', '<s> we have very different qualities and we are extremely different </s>', '<s> and i’m different from all of the other candidates </s>', '<s> look nobody can negotiate trade deals like me </s>', '<s> we are going to take the 400 billion a year that we’re losing with china that’s going to be turned around </s>', '<s> the 75 billion a year that we’re short on with japan </s>', '<s> the 50 billion a year that we lost to mexico </s>', '<s> and that’s right there will be a wall built </s>', '<s> it will go up </s>', '<s> it will be built </s>', '<s> and people will come into the country legally </s>', '<s> so i mean much different than – you’re look at marco rubio – very very weak on illegal immigration </s>', '<s> you look at ben and he’s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of medicare </s>', '<s> i mean ben wants to get rid of medicare </s>', '<s> you can’t get rid of medicare </s>', '<s> it’d be a horrible thing to get rid of </s>', '<s> it actually works </s>', '<s> you get rid of the fraud waste and abuse </s>', '<s> it works </s>', '<s> so when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of medicare i don’t know how he stays here </s>', '<s> no i think that really marco is over-rated </s>', '<s> and frankly had bush been a better messenger he has the better message </s>', '<s> i mean if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn’t been able to – marco doesn’t show up to the united states senate </s>', '<s> he’s representing the people of florida which by the way that poll just came out today and i’m way up in florida over everybody </s>', '<s> but marco is a sitting senator and he doesn’t show up for the people of florida and i don’t think he should be doing that </s>', '<s> now bush gave a very weak message </s>', '<s> i agree with that </s>', '<s> it was poorly delivered </s>', '<s> but the facts are on bush’s side and ultimately i think marco’s going to be hurt very badly </s>', '<s> and if you look at mr singer you have to see where mr singer is coming from and when you see where he’s coming from i think people are going to say whoa we didn’t know that </s>', '<s> but look at marco’s stance on illegal immigration </s>', '<s> it’s really trouble for him </s>', '<s> i don’t see how he can win </s>', '<s> marco rubio’s personal finances are discredit…all you have to do is look at his credit card </s>', '<s> i mean he is a disaster with his credit cards </s>', '<s> and i’ll tell you what i love florida </s>', '<s> i’m in florida all the time </s>', '<s> and for years i’ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster </s>', '<s> i would think that when you take a look at it you would find that </s>', '<s> but his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards i’ve heard about it for years </s>', '<s> you’ll have to find out </s>', '<s> well he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses with his – you know he certainly lives above his means </s>', '<s> there’s no question about that </s>', '<s> …i’ll tell you what </s>', '<s> on the debates it’s very interesting </s>', '<s> because i don’t really care that much </s>', '<s> i want a room </s>', '<s> i want a podium </s>', '<s> and let’s get going </s>', '<s> because i don’t really care that much </s>', '<s> but a lot of the people that are candidates who i respect – many of them not all of them – but i respect many of them they felt it was very unfair because hillary clinton was given all soft balls </s>', '<s> i mean she wasn’t asked one tough question </s>', '<s> they didn’t talk about her foundation </s>', '<s> they didn’t talk about any of the problems </s>', '<s> they didn’t talk about the emails </s>', '<s> when the email problem came up bernie sanders lost his whole campaign </s>', '<s> i mean what he did was so stupid from his standpoint </s>', '<s> in order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause he gave up the emails </s>', '<s> that was end of his campaign </s>', '<s> first of all people aren’t going to his rallies anymore </s>', '<s> he’s finished </s>', '<s> so unless something happens to her with respect to the emails she’ll easily be the candidate </s>', '<s> but i will say this she only got softballs </s>', '<s> that’s all she got </s>', '<s> and if you look at the way we were treated it wasn’t the same way </s>', '<s> with that being said i don’t really care </s>', '<s> well i think the republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall </s>', '<s> they coalesced at that last debate because i mean it really started with me </s>', '<s> the guy asked me a question </s>', '<s> i think harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter </s>', '<s> he’s a disaster </s>', '<s> and he was – it was such as horribly put question and so obvious </s>', '<s> and the republicans coalesced around each other </s>', '<s> it was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it </s>', '<s> and all we want to do is to be treated fairly </s>', '<s> but with me i don’t care that much </s>', '<s> just give me a podium </s>', '<s> what i would say is this the networks have made a fortune because of me not because of anybody else </s>', '<s> you know they were saying that the last cycle they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn’t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> nobody wanted to watch </s>', '<s> now they have 25 million people 24 million people 23 million people and 16 million people </s>', '<s> i mean give me a break </s>', '<s> so somebody said how did they get there </s>', '<s> and actually variety and hollywood reporter who do report this stuff pretty well – much better than the political press – they said solely for one reason – it was trump </s>', '<s> i’ll take the credit </s>', '<s> but i’ll tell you what i also want </s>', '<s> i think that wounded warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates – enormous profits – by the way beyond anything they’ve ever envisioned </s>', '<s> cnn was going to get 2000 for a 30 second ad </s>', '<s> they ended up getting 250000 </s>', '<s> so they went from 2000 to 250000 for a 30 second ad </s>', '<s> the networks and the cable are making a fortune and i think they should give some of the profits to the wounded warriors and the veterans </s>', '<s> that’s what i want </s>', '<s> i’m giving them away </s>', '<s> i’m giving the profits of my book – i’m giving them away to a lot of different – including the vets </s>', '<s> …i have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women </s>', '<s> this building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn’t see that in the construction trades </s>', '<s> i mean it was totally unique </s>', '<s> i have many many executives upstairs and in different buildings that i have that are women </s>', '<s> many – a proportion that’s close to 50 </s>', '<s> might even be over 50 if i analyze it </s>', '<s> and they get paid a lot of money – in many cases more than men doing the same job </s>', '<s> so women have always appreciated that about me </s>', '<s> i’ve been in terms of employment really a standout and i’ve been honored for doing so well with women </s>', '<s> what jeb bush was saying at the last debate </s>', '<s> i don’t know </s>', '<s> but he didn’t say it well </s>', '<s> …i like telemundo by the way </s>', '<s> i like it better than univision </s>', '<s> i’m suing univision for 500 million </s>', '<s> …because the country is doing so poorly </s>', '<s> it’s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly </s>', '<s> that’s good </s>', '<s> they’re going to have some demonstrations </s>', '<s> oh good because it’ll get even higher ratings if they do that </s>', '<s> i think it’s fine </s>', '<s> i think they should demonstrate </s>', '<s> ratings will go even higher than they are going to be </s>', '<s> it’s going to be one of the highest rated shows ever </s>', '<s> and they’re very excited about it </s>', '<s> and i have a great relationship as you know from telemundo with the hispanics </s>', '<s> you’ve treated me actually very fairly </s>', '<s> won the poll recently in nevada </s>', '<s> won other polls </s>', '<s> and in nevada i think i got 37 and leading everybody </s>', '<s> so i have a great relationship with the hispanics </s>', '<s> i have working for me thousands right now – thousands of hispanics </s>', '<s> i’ve had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me </s>', '<s> i’m a job machine </s>', '<s> i’m a job machine </s>', '<s> and one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close </s>', '<s> i’m two three and you see that – two three four five times greater than anybody else </s>', '<s> and you’d almost say like it’s about the jobs it’s about the economy </s>', '<s> then how’s anybody going to beat trump in all fairness </s>', '<s> but i’ve had a great relationship with the workers </s>', '<s> i’ve had a great relationship with jobs </s>', '<s> and i’ve had an amazing relationship with the hispanics

</s>', '<s> but i show some of the great developments that i have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good i show my financial statement from a year and a half two years ago </s>', '<s> now it’s even better but we didn’t have that certified yet </s>', '<s> so i do that not in a braggadocious way </s>', '<s> i do that because that’s the kind of thinking our country

unless they have bad intentions which i don’t believe they do </s>', '<s> but we are run by incompetent people </s>', '<s> we have incompetent leadership </s>', '<s> there are so many things </s>', '<s> like i mentioned corporate inversion </s>', '<s> the democrats want the money to come back </s>', '<s> who doesn’t </s>', '<s> the republicans want the money to come back </s>', '<s> for three years the democrats have said we want the money to come back </s>', '<s> for three years the democrats and the republicans agree 100 </s>', '<s> you have a vast majority </s>', '<s> maybe everybody

'<s> there are those people that probably wouldn’t have want him to back </s>', '<s> but we’ll see </s>', '<s> i’ll talk to you </s>', '<s> no they all agree </s>', '<s> they all agree </s>', '<s> they just didn’t want to go through the unfair questions because they weren’t questions they were statements </s>', '<s> you see they were asking – they were giving statements in a sarcastic disgusting way </s>', '<s> and by the way i think becky is terrific and i think carl is terrific </s>', '<s> but i think john harwood is not very good at what he does </s>', '<s> but i think becky quick is a terrific person </s>', '<s> i think carl is a terrific person </s>', '<s> but i will tell you john harwood was a disgrace to cnbc </s>', '<s> …the question is should the fed raise rates </s>', '<s> they are not raising them because obama has asked them not to raise them </s>', '<s> in my opinion he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen </s>', '<s> and in my opinion janet yellen is highly political and she’s not raising rates for a very specific reason because obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn’t want to see a big bubble burst during his administration </s>', '<s> janet yellen should have raised the rates </s>', '<s> she’s not doing it because the obama administration and the president doesn’t want her to </s>', '<s> and if she does it you see what happens every time there’s even a thought of raising them just a little bit </s>', '<s> and one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies </s>', '<s> because if you look at the devaluations of china of japan of many many different countries they’re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don’t have leaders that know how to say to china don’t do that </s>', '<s> don’t do that </s>', '<s> because if you do that we’re going to put a big fat tax on you </s>', '<s> don’t do that </s>', '<s> and you know what </s>', '<s> if you said that they wouldn’t do it </s>', '<s> if you have the right messenger… i’m really focused on one very big election one very important election and there are some pretty good elections </s>', '<s> i’m not watching any of them in particular </s>', '<s> i’ll be watching them on tuesday night </s>', '<s> but i’ll be out there we’ll be out voting </s>', '<s> but the election that i’m watching is the election for the presidency of the united states </s>', '<s> that is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we’ve ever had in this country </s>', '<s> we’re so far behind </s>', '<s> and we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership </s>', '<s> that’s a good question </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> so simon and schuster came up to me </s>', '<s> they wanted to do a book </s>', '<s> they wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that’s what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country </s>', '<s> and i said i’ll do it but we have to talk about the country </s>', '<s> what happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover do to a picture </s>', '<s> and he did some great…photos </s>', '<s> i’m smiling </s>', '<s> i’m happy </s>', '<s> i look good </s>', '<s> everything was fine </s>', '<s> and then he took one where i wasn’t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture </s>', '<s> and then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture i had was that one </s>', '<s> it’s a terrible horrible nasty picture </s>', '<s> but when you’re talking about crippled america and you’re talking about all of the problems we have i can’t have a big smiley face up there </s>', '<s> so that’s how we picked it </s>', '<s> we picked the worst photo taken of me </s>', '<s> i would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn’t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book and actually simon and schuster agreed with me </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> are the other republicans afraid to debate </s>', '<s> well some of them should be </s>', '<s> thank you very much everybody </s>', '<s> thank you </s>', '<s> …i was telling some of the folks backstage i never ever thought we’d do this well this fast </s>', '<s> this has been so incredible </s>', '<s> what’s happened all over </s>', '<s> what’s happened in iowa </s>', '<s> it’s been really incredible </s>', '<s> we’ve had some amazing results and they continue to come in </s>', '<s> got a little shake-up in iowa </s>', '<s> i don’t know what’s going on </s>', '<s> somebody said are you going straight to new hampshire </s>', '<s> now i love new hampshire </s>', '<s> we’ve got great numbers </s>', '<s> 38 to 12 </s>', '<s> that’s good </s>', '<s> but we fell a little behind in iowa and some people are saying how can it be </s>', '<s> and i come out and i was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds we have the most enthusiastic crowds </s>', '<s> everybody said and it’s very true </s>', '<s> i mean look at this </s>', '<s> somebody else would come they’d have like 50 people and they wouldn’t need this room </s>', '<s> believe me </s>', '<s> but everybody said without question in every poll – this isn’t just here – that the people that are with

couple of times i say well that could be the end </s>', '<s> then they do something and i’m 10 points up </s>', '<s> it’s the craziest thing right </s>', '<s> but we’ll take it </s>', '<s> but they say the people are with – we have the most loyal people by far </s>', '<s> everybody says it </s>', '<s> the other thing they say is for leadership number one </s>', '<s> very important right </s>', '<s> don’t you think </s>', '<s> leadership </s>', '<s> i mean when leadership is number one – they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot </s>', '<s> so you know it’s great </s>', '<s> i thought i’d talk a little bit and i want to take some questions </s>', '<s> you know we can do a little question and answer </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> we have all these cameras going back here </s>', '<s> and you know it’s always tough when you’re on live television all the time </s>', '<s> look we have 10 topics </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> how many topics </s>', '<s> 10 </s>', '<s> how many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics </s>', '<s> the bottom line is we want results </s>', '<s> we want to get it done </s>', '<s> but when you’re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you’re talking about immigration and you’re talking about the wall because we’re going to have a wall and we’re going to stop illegal immigration </s>', '<s> but we talk about trade and we talk about repealing obamacare </s>', '<s> and we talk about all the things that we talk about </s>', '<s> but you know you have these points and

have to tell you legal – you come in and we’re going to have a good time and you’re going to be there and you’re going to do great – and visas – maybe work maybe there are cases where you need people

'<s> okay let’s do a couple of questions </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> come on </s>', '<s> …you know we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country </s>', '<s> now you look like you’re doing pretty well in all fairness </s>', '<s> but still we have 50 million </s>', '<s> we have 46 million people and they’re getting food stamps </s>', '<s> 46 million </s>', '<s> think of it </s>', '<s> you know we talk about how well we’re doing </s>', '<s> so we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty food stamps and it’s got to end </s>', '<s> one of the problems – we don’t have enough jobs in this country </s>', '<s> it’s very simple </s>', '<s> you know it’s so simple when you think about it </s>', '<s> our jobs have been taken away </s>', '<s> and i’ll tell you what else middle income folks – their salaries haven’t gone up in 12 years </s>', '<s> people are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago </s>', '<s> and other things have gone up </s>', '<s> so they’re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago </s>', '<s> but that’s an amazing stat </s>', '<s> but people – one of the reasons they say i’m doing so well because i let people know we’re going to bring jobs back </s>', '<s> we’re going to bring industry and plants </s>', '<s> we’re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that </s>', '<s> we’re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they’re working </s>', '<s> then the other thing you have a lot of part-time jobs </s>', '<s> i have some people that i know very well and they’ve had a job for 20 years at the same place </s>', '<s> all of a sudden they’re working part-time because of obamacare because from an accounting standpoint it just works better </s>', '<s> they love the owners the stores and things </s>', '<s> they love the owners they think the owners are great </s>', '<s> but the owners are forced to make part-time jobs they have part-time jobs </s>', '<s> they work all their life </s>', '<s> they have a wonderful company that they’re working for and now all of a sudden they’re cut into part-time jobs because of obamacare because of the rulings of obamacare </s>', '<s> and you all know what i’m talking about </s>', '<s> so they end up being part-time workers and they don’t want to be part-time workers </s>', '<s> they don’t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker </s>', '<s> and we’re not going to have that stuff anymore </s>', '<s> we’re not going to have it any more </s>', '<s> we’re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up </s>', '<s> believe me </s>', '<s> the numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that’s a shame …tell you what as president i can guarantee it </s>', '<s> as trump i can say i’ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won’t stop </s>', '<s> it’ll be easier to take todd and just say look we’re going to work with you todd </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> so will you get me that number and everything and we’ll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here </s>', '<s> you have problems with the va also huh </s>', '<s> terrible </s>', '<s> i hear only – i just hear terrible </s>', '<s> and we’re going to solve that problem </s>', '<s> you know it can be solved </s>', '<s> the waits now for the va are longer than they’ve ever been…the waits now are worse than they’ve ever been </s>', '<s> thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor </s>', '<s> okay dying </s>', '<s> and you find the same thing you say </s>', '<s> you have to use your own because they won’t do anything </s>', '<s> so we’re going to take care of our vets and we’re going to take care of the va and it’s going to be one of the things we’re going to be releasing pretty soon </s>', '<s> but one of the things we’re going to do with the va we have a lot of hospitals that aren’t doing any business </s>', '<s> we have a lot of private doctors that could do more business </s>', '<s> we’re losing a lot of our doctors because of obamacare </s>', '<s> they’re retiring </s>', '<s> they’re leaving </s>', '<s> one of them – a friend of mine – said i have more nurses working for me now more than before but i have more accountants and the end result is a disaster he’s getting out of the business </s>', '<s> he’s got nurses but he’s got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy </s>', '<s> so one of the things we’re going to do is if todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait – because the waits are unbelievable – 5 6 7 days sometimes </s>', '<s> they’re going to a private doctor </s>', '<s> they’re going to go to a private hospital </s>', '<s> or a public hospital that’s in the area </s>', '<s> and we’re going to pay for that and it’s going to cost less money – it’s going to cost less money than the system we have now – and you’re going to end up getting much better care </s>', '<s> it’s going to cost less and you’re going to get better care… so the keystone pipeline first of all i’d approve it because it’s thousands of jobs </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> i would approve it so fast so fast </s>', '<s> and hillary should have approved it </s>', '<s> you know hillary wanted to approve it but she’s been

</s>', '<s> we’re bringing oil from canada </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> i may say i want 10 </s>', '<s> we’re going to approve it but i want 10 15 </s>', '<s> because the truth is that the keystone

is a problem for them </s>', '<s> very expensive to get it out </s>', '<s> we have great stuff </s>', '<s> so i would approve it because i love the jobs of building it </s>', '<s> i love the jobs of building it </s>', '<s> but i may just say maybe we should get 10 15 maybe 20 as that oil flows through our land </s>', '<s> you know maybe we should do that </s>', '<s> so i’m going to look into that

approving it we’re not really getting anything </s>', '<s> they’re putting it underground and that’s actually good environmentally </s>', '<s> better than having trucks going down the road and

costs of what’s going on in this country </s>', '<s> if you look at what we’re doing and the money we’re spending </s>', '<s> i read where a washer – you know what a washer is </s>', '<s> nuts bolts

going to have growth that will be tremendous </s>', '<s> and by the way if we have more than 3 these numbers are really spectacular </s>', '<s> and one of the things that they don’t take into account

deductions and that’s one of the reasons we’re able to lower it </s>', '<s> this is actually a tax reduction </s>', '<s> a big tax reduction including for the upper income </s>', '<s> i believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won’t be getting certain deductions which aren’t fair for them to be getting that they’ll end up doing better </s>', '<s> i just think this is a

think it’s supply side or anything else </s>', '<s> i think this is a common sense well thought out tax proposal that’s going to trigger the economy going to make everybody go back and really want to

fairness </s>', '<s> i don’t have to be treated any differently than anybody else </s>', '<s> i just wanted fairness from the republican party </s>', '<s> we’re leading in every single poll </s>', '<s> a new poll came out today where we’re over 30 </s>', '<s> we’ve actually hit numbers as high as 35 and 40 </s>', '<s> and frankly i’ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the democrats and very easily i think beat the democrats no matter who it may be whether it’s hillary or anybody else and i think maybe hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what’s happening getting to the starting gate the best way for the republicans to win is if i win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up </s>', '<s> and for that reason i have signed the pledge </s>', '<s> so i will be totally pledging my allegiance to the republican party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win </s>', '<s> we will win </s>', '<s> and most importantly we will make our country great again because that’s what it’s all about </s>', '<s> we have to make our country great again </s>', '<s> this is a self-funded campaign </s>', '<s> we have our heart in it </s>', '<s> we have our soul in it </s>', '<s> i don’t need money and i don’t want money </s>', '<s> and this is going to be a campaign like i think no other </s>', '<s> i’m not controlled by lobbyists </s>', '<s> i’m not controlled by anybody </s>', '<s> i’m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again </s>', '<s> yeah i got nothing </s>', '<s> i really got nothing </s>', '<s> the question was what did i get for signing the pledge </s>', '<s> absolutely nothing </s>', '<s> other than the assurance that i would be treated fairly </s>', '<s> and i’ve seen that over the last two months </s>', '<s> they really have been very fair </s>', '<s> no i have no intention of changing my mind </s>', '<s> well i think the big thing that’s changed is – and it’s been obvious to all – number one after i announced we went up like a rocket ship </s>', '<s> nobody thought i was going to run and they said oh he won’t run and he won’t put in his papers </s>', '<s> and he wouldn’t do all of this </s>', '<s> i did that </s>', '<s> the papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular </s>', '<s> it’s a great company </s>', '<s> i built a great company </s>', '<s> and all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received </s>', '<s> and i think the thing that’s changed is the fact that i went to number one place very quickly after i signed and after i in this building notified everybody that i’d be running for president </s>', '<s> so i think the biggest thing is that i went early to number one and the rnc has treated me with great respect </s>', '<s> so that was very important </s>', '<s> no i see no circumstances under which i would tear up that pledge </s>', '<s> well you don’t have to be met when you’re at 2 </s>', '<s> it’s one of those things </s>', '<s> that’s the way life works </s>', '<s> and i like gov </s>', '<s> chris christie

assimilation takes </s>', '<s> and that’s how – i mean whether people like it or not that’s how we assimilate and that’s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage </s>', '<s> and that’s how people that don’t speak – and i’m not just talking about spanish i’m talking about from various parts of the world – that’s how they will become successful and do great </s>', '<s> so i think it’s more appropriate to be speaking english </s>', '<s> well one of the things i want to do and i feel very strongly it’s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws </s>', '<s> and when people come into the country illegally we should not allow that </s>', '<s> and this is not from south america </s>', '<s> this is not from mexico </s>', '<s> this is from all over the world </s>', '<s> when people come illegally we cannot allow that </s>', '<s> and i want people to come legally </s>', '<s> i want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess

been proven right </s>', '<s> and many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me which i very much appreciate </s>', '<s> of course they haven’t done it publicly but these are

a company called genesco </s>', '<s> genesco </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> so they were based in nashville tennessee and they owned the bonwit teller department store chain </s>', '<s> and i was a young guy and i came from brooklyn in queens and i wanted to go into manhattan </s>', '<s> and i went into manhattan and i did the grand hyatt hotel and i did some other things that were good </s>', '<s> but the thing i wanted more than anything was fifth avenue between 57th and 56th street which is called the tiffany location right next to tiffany </s>', '<s> and that’s what i wanted </s>', '<s> i wanted that piece of property so badly </s>', '<s> i shouldn’t say that because you’re not supposed to want things like that so badly </s>', '<s> god will get angry at me right </s>', '<s> but i wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was genesco based in nashville tennessee </s>', '<s> and i came in and i came to nashville and i met with the heads of genesco who were really great people actually </s>', '<s> and they were having a lot of difficulties </s>', '<s> there were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything </s>', '<s> and i convinced them to sell me the land and the building </s>', '<s> and i bought the bonwit teller store fifth avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding tiffany </s>', '<s> i bought all the air rights and then ultimately i bought the air rights from tiffany and i built trump tower </s>', '<s> and to this day it’s one of the great buildings of the world and it’s one of the great successes </s>', '<s> and i love country music and i went to the grand ole opry while i was here </s>', '<s> and i just had such an incredible experience </s>', '<s> and when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places – you know when you’re leading in every poll they sort of want you </s>', '<s> when you’re not leading in the polls like so many of these guys they don’t want you at all </s>', '<s> and we’ll talk about the polls in a second </s>', '<s> but i had a lot of choices for this morning and i guess i could have also gone and played golf like the president does all the time right </s>', '<s> but i decided let’s do this </s>', '<s> and i really chose nashville because the experience is one of my – it’s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it’s so important and it’s been such a great – from the day i built it it was a home run </s>', '<s> and it all really took place because of nashville tennessee </s>', '<s> so i really – it’s an honor to be with you folks i can tell you </s>', '<s> real honor </s>', '<s> so coming over i heard and i watched television – you know they have all these cameras back there and they’re live </s>', '<s> and i guess we’re live on cnn we’re live on so many different things </s>', '<s> it’s always difficult </s>', '<s> you know when you’re always live you’ve got to change up your speech </s>', '<s> you can’t make the speech over and over… the other candidates don’t get covered

</s>', '<s> so i would’ve said they would have had a million or two </s>', '<s> so i say they have 24 million people </s>', '<s> and i say well now the second debate which is on cnn – that was on fox maybe i should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity </s>', '<s> does that make sense </s>', '<s> all to charity </s>', '<s> all to charity </s>', '<s> when i said that to the writers at time magazine they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story </s>', '<s> and i said you know and i sort of thought i said it off the record but they put it in time magazine </s>', '<s> so now – maybe should i ask for charity maybe a nice nashville charity and american cancer society and aids research – so many of this – there’s so many good – alzheimer’s – you know there’s so many things going on </s>', '<s> maybe i should ask for a lot of money or i’m not showing up </s>', '<s> you know it’s interesting </s>', '<s> so they’ll get 2 million – a million to 2 million people at the debates </s>', '<s> you know they’ve been doing them for a long time </s>', '<s> they don’t do great especially the early republican debate </s>', '<s> like you know the expression – it draws flies </s>', '<s> that’s what it draws </s>', '<s> so this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television </s>', '<s> i think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television </s>', '<s> naturally i took full credit for it which in all fairness i should </s>', '<s> i should </s>', '<s> so bottom line i think i might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know </s>', '<s> but i did say is it a little hokey if i do that </s>', '<s> maybe it’s not so nice </s>', '<s> so what do you think </s>', '<s> should i do it or not </s>', '<s> maybe not </s>', '<s> i don’t know </s>', '<s> here’s the thing </s>', '<s> if i don’t do it cnn just makes a lot of money </s>', '<s> i don’t care about cnn </s>', '<s> honestly </s>', '<s> no they’re going to make a lot of money </s>', '<s> they just shut off their camera </s>', '<s> they’re actually very nice </s>', '<s> but they’re going to make a lot of money and you know it’s something we should consider </s>', '<s> so we’ll all consider it together </s>', '<s> but coming over today i saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the dreamers having to do with children and you know the dreams of children </s>', '<s> and these are people who come over to the country and they’re dreamers </s>', '<s> and i said what about our children </s>', '<s> why can’t our children that are in the country why can’t they be the dreamers </s>', '<s> nobody ever talks about that </s>', '<s> no no nobody ever talks about that </s>', '<s> you know we talk about the dreamers we talk about illegal immigrants who by the way are treated better than our vets </s>', '<s> you know our vets are incredible </s>', '<s> no no the illegal immigrants in many cases…are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have – our wounded warriors are – these are the greatest people we have </s>', '<s> and another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say good morning ladies and gentlemen </s>', '<s> nashville it’s wonderful – you know is that i can sort of be very current </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> i can be very very current </s>', '<s> i can talk about what’s happening </s>', '<s> this morning on the television they had a whole story about the veterans administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in </s>', '<s> these are our veterans </s>', '<s> these are the people that got hurt fighting for us </s>', '<s> maybe we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them to be honest with you </s>', '<s> i mean that’s possible too </s>', '<s> they had a story this morning on fox on cnn and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there’s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there’s nobody there </s>', '<s> and the veterans – i don’t know probably some of you saw it the veterans are saying where are the people </s>', '<s> and then they said what happened </s>', '<s> and they said this happens all the time </s>', '<s> there was not even – nobody even there </s>', '<s> and two weeks ago on wednesday they had the longest wait in the history – in the history of the veterans administration for people wanting to see a doctor </s>', '<s> when i go to a doctor if i have to wait like 9 minutes i’m like get me – i’d go crazy </s>', '<s> it’s true </s>', '<s> remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> beada remembers that </s>', '<s> you’d have a cold </s>', '<s> the doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big beautiful little bag being at the top </s>', '<s> and he’d come over to your house check you out fine </s>', '<s> those days don’t exist anymore </s>', '<s> you know we’re in age of obamacare where nothing exists </s>', '<s> by the way we will repeal and replace obamacare </s>', '<s> that i can tell you </s>', '<s> that i can tell you </s>', '<s> but so two weeks ago wednesday the longest wait in the history of the veterans administration </s>', '<s> so that if you go to the doctor’s office men and women are waiting four days three days one was five days </s>', '<s> one case was five days or six days finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation </s>', '<s> now you think about that </s>', '<s> can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day </s>', '<s> but these people are waiting four five days </s>', '<s> so the wait’s now the longest in history and that’s the way we’re treating our greatest people and that’s not right and we’re going to change that </s>', '<s> we’re going to change that </s>', '<s> we have right now – and people don’t know this </s>', '<s> you know they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically </s>', '<s> all talk no action politicians </s>', '<s> and i mean on both sides in all fairness </s>', '<s> you know i’m a republican </s>', '<s> i’m a conservative </s>', '<s> but i’m just as angry

</s>', '<s> we’re going to do this </s>', '<s> we’re going to do that </s>', '<s> then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings and they go oh i made it

</s>', '<s> i promise </s>', '<s> i promise </s>', '<s> but you know they show those phony statistics where we’re 54 unemployment </s>', '<s> 54 </s>', '<s> the real number </s>', '<s> you know i actually saw a number it could be 42 okay believe it or not </s>', '<s> but when you think about it we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force </s>', '<s> 93 million people </s>', '<s> of the 93 many of these people want jobs </s>', '<s> and they quit looking </s>', '<s> so if you’re looking for a job and you can’t find it and you stop for a while – you know after a

owe it to the chinese a lot of it </s>', '<s> we owe it to other countries </s>', '<s> theyre the ones that hold the debt </s>', '<s> and then we give them money </s>', '<s> we have countries that we

'<s> it cant be mitt because mitt ran and failed </s>', '<s> he failed </s>', '<s> i mean i liked him </s>', '<s> look--like him dislike him--the 47 statement that he made thats not going away </s>', '<s> the romneycare from massachusetts thats not going away </s>', '<s> what do you think theyre going to say oh we wont bring that up this time </s>', '<s> its not fair because it was a long t-- that doesnt work </s>', '<s> but more importantly he choked </s>', '<s> something happened to him in the last month </s>', '<s> he had that election won </s>', '<s> and let me tell you something </s>', '<s> that election sort of like a dealmaker that cant close the deal </s>', '<s> i know many of those guys they get it up to the one-yard line they go ah ah i cant close it </s>', '<s> or a golfer

another chance cause actually i think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president </s>', '<s> i really do </s>', '<s> i think beating obama would have been a much easier one than the one thats coming up which is sad to say but true </s>', '<s> so you cant have romney </s>', '<s> he choked </s>', '<s> you cant have bush </s>', '<s> the last thing we need is another bush </s>', '<s> now i made that statement very strongly and now every one says the last thing-- you know they copied it </s>', '<s> ill be accused of copying the statement thats the bad thing </s>', '<s> but i said it </s>', '<s> i was the one that said it first and i mean it </s>', '<s> the last thing we need is another bush </s>', '<s> now hes totally in favor of common core thats a disaster thats bad it should be local and all of that </s>', '<s> but hes totally in favor of common core </s>', '<s> hes very very weak on immigration </s>', '<s> dont forget--remember his statement--they come for love </s>', '<s> i say what </s>', '<s> come for love </s>', '<s> youve got these people coming half of them are criminals </s>', '<s> theyre coming for love </s>', '<s> theyre coming for a lot of other reasons and its not love </s>', '<s> and when he runs you got to remember his brother really gave us obama </s>', '<s> i was never a big fan but his brother gave us obama </s>', '<s> cause abraham

appointed justice roberts </s>', '<s> and jeb wanted justice roberts </s>', '<s> and justice roberts basically approved obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes </s>', '<s> so you cant have jeb bush </s>', '<s> and hes going to lose aside from that hes not going to win </s>', '<s> so mitt and--you just cant have those two </s>', '<s> thats it </s>', '<s> thats it </s>', '<s> its so simple </s>', '<s> so just in summing up and i just wrote a few of these little points down because its very important </s>', '<s> and i watch these teleprompters and by the way i think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter because we got one that uses teleprompters </s>', '<s> and people say oh he is so quick on his feet </s>', '<s> he is reading it </s>', '<s> i mean give me a break </s>', '<s> everything is read </s>', '<s> you dont really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk </s>', '<s> and thats what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters </s>', '<s> but so when i look at these things here i say you know what its so much easier it would be so nice just bah pa bah pa bah bing bing bing </s>', '<s> no problems get off stage everybody falls asleep and thats the end of that </s>', '<s> but we have to do something about these teleprompters </s>', '<s> but in looking at these situations-- i built an incredible company </s>', '<s> and youll see that </s>', '<s> an incredible company a wonderful company </s>', '<s> i employ thousands of people and i love doing what im doing </s>', '<s> and in a certain way i wish i werent doing this but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix </s>', '<s> we have such great potential </s>', '<s> so if i run for president and if i win i would totally succeed in creating jobs defeating isis and stopping the islamic terrorists--and you have to do that reducing the budget deficit--so important have to do it securing our southern border--and i mean seriously securing it stopping nuclear weapons in iran and elsewhere saving social security medicare and medicaid without cutting it down to the bone because its not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and its not fair to future people coming up and we can do it repealing obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people and far less expensive both for the people and for the country </s>', '<s> and believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody </s>', '<s> and everybody can be covered </s>', '<s> im not saying leave 50-percent of the people out </s>', '<s> everybody can be c-- this plan is just a basic disaster </s>', '<s> nobody knows </s>', '<s> as bad as the website was this is how bad the

another </s>', '<s> they just kept coming and coming </s>', '<s> we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya to president obama’s line in the sand in syria </s>', '<s> each of these actions have

our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster </s>', '<s> no vision </s>', '<s> no purpose </s>', '<s> no direction </s>', '<s> no strategy </s>', '<s> today i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy </s>', '<s> first our resources are totally over extended </s>', '<s> president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy </s>', '<s> he’s crippled us with wasteful spending massive debt low growth a huge trade deficit and open borders </s>', '<s> our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching 1 trillion a year </s>', '<s> we’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own </s>', '<s> ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength </s>', '<s> i am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem </s>', '<s> i’m the only one — believe me i know them all i’m the only one who knows how to fix it </s>', '<s> secondly our allies are not paying their fair share and i’ve been talking about this recently a lot </s>', '<s> our allies must contribute toward their financial political and human costs have to do it of our tremendous security burden </s>', '<s> but many of them are simply not doing so </s>', '<s> they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us </s>', '<s> in nato for instance only 4 of 28 other member countries besides america are spending the minimum required 2 percent of gdp on defense </s>', '<s> we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes missiles ships equipment building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia </s>', '<s> the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense and if not the us must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves </s>', '<s> we have no choice </s>', '<s> the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security </s>', '<s> a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded and funded beautifully

in the history of our country </s>', '<s> he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry </s>', '<s> iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon cannot be allowed </s>', '<s> remember that cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon </s>', '<s> and under a trump administration will never ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon </s>', '<s> all of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly i remember that day </s>', '<s> in negotiation you must be willing to walk </s>', '<s> the iran deal like so many of our worst agreements is the result of not being willing to leave the table </s>', '<s> when the other side knows you’re not going to walk it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win </s>', '<s> at the same time your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them </s>', '<s> you’ve made that agreement you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place </s>', '<s> president obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile

friend to israel </s>', '<s> he has treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power </s>', '<s> iran has indeed become a great great power in just a very short period of time because

oldest friends and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help </s>', '<s> remember that </s>', '<s> not good </s>', '<s> fourth our rivals no longer respect us </s>', '<s> in fact they’re just as confused as our allies but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore </s>', '<s> the truth is they don’t respect us </s>', '<s> when president obama landed in cuba on air force one no leader was there nobody to greet him </s>', '<s> perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one </s>', '<s> then amazingly the same thing happened in saudi arabia </s>', '<s> it’s called no respect </s>', '<s> absolutely no respect </s>', '<s> do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen denmark to get the olympics for our country and after this unprecedented effort it was announced that the united states came in fourth — fourth place </s>', '<s> the president of the united states making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place </s>', '<s> he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment </s>', '<s> we were laughed at all over the world as we have been many

and then gets killed by the same people </s>', '<s> so we backed people that turned out to be far worse than gadhafi </s>', '<s> look at what we did in iraq </s>', '<s> look at what we did in iraq </s>', '<s> i mean what the hell did we get </s>', '<s> we spent 2 trillion and that was as a year and a half ago </s>', '<s> i keep saying two or three it’s a lot more than that </s>', '<s> we spent

we have wounded warriors who i love all of </s>', '<s> these guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people </s>', '<s> you know these are the greatest people </s>', '<s> and then what happens </s>', '<s> we leave and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving </s>', '<s> so i said man if i’m the enemy i’m just going to go wait for 18 months right </s>', '<s> he gave a date </s>', '<s> we are leaving iraq we will be gone by such and such a time </s>', '<s> i said i’m just sitting there watching and i’m saying man that’s really stupid </s>', '<s> because believe me the enemy doesn’t want to be killed </s>', '<s> you know you hear so much oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go right </s>', '<s> they don’t </s>', '<s> they want to live </s>', '<s> and they want to take care of their families always their families </s>', '<s> you remember that because their families know what’s going on ok </s>', '<s> you think their wives don’t know what

know exactly what’s going on </s>', '<s> remember that </s>', '<s> and frankly i think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives ok </s>', '<s> but they still want

well </s>', '<s> why should they fight when they know in 18 months they can go in and take the place </s>', '<s> so what happens </s>', '<s> so we have isis taking a lot of oil </s>', '<s> i said take the oil </s>', '<s> remember when we left i was opposed to going in because i said you’re going to destabilize the middle east </s>', '<s> because you had iraq and you had iran </s>', '<s> and i said they fight they’re always fighting for decades and decades for generations </s>', '<s> they fight that’s what they do </s>', '<s> they fight </s>', '<s> how we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe </s>', '<s> they fight and they were equal militarily </s>', '<s> they go this way 10 feet </s>', '<s> they go this way 10 feet </s>', '<s> then they rest a couple of years then they start fighting again </s>', '<s> then saddam hussein throws a little gas </s>', '<s> everyone goes crazy </s>', '<s> oh it’s because ph of gas </s>', '<s> they go back and forth </s>', '<s> it’s the same </s>', '<s> and they were stabilized </s>', '<s> and i said if you go after one or the other in this case iraq you’re going to destabilize the middle east </s>', '<s> that’s what going to happen </s>', '<s> you’re going to destabilize the middle east </s>', '<s> and that’s exactly what happened </s>', '<s> we totally destabilized the middle east </s>', '<s> we have now migrations largely because of what’s happened afterwards </s>', '<s> you know iraq was horrible </s>', '<s> it was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in </s>', '<s> but we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out </s>', '<s> and we shouldn’t have given dates </s>', '<s> i mean i would have probably said we are going to stay forever </s>', '<s> and they would have said oh man </s>', '<s> and then keep going keep going and eventually they would get tired and say this guy is crazy </s>', '<s> i mean he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal </s>', '<s> but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said they just pull back </s>', '<s> and then as soon as we left they come in ok </s>', '<s> so they have the oil </s>', '<s> you know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right </s>', '<s> china </s>', '<s> always china </s>', '<s> i love china </s>', '<s> i love mexico </s>', '<s> their leaders are too smart for us </s>', '<s> we have no border </s>', '<s>

to come through a legal process </s>', '<s> so with iraq so we give them the date and they take over </s>', '<s> we didn’t take the year </s>', '<s> so for four years i have been talking about it </s>', '<s> then because of paris all of sudden they start bombing the oil </s>', '<s> but i didn’t want to just bomb the oil </s>', '<s> i wanted to take oil </s>', '<s> they’re bombing </s>', '<s> you know we are bombing </s>', '<s> great </s>', '<s> what’s going to happen after that </s>', '<s> so we’re bombing </s>', '<s> and you know we are not really bombing it because they are still selling it </s>', '<s> i said how could they keep selling it </s>', '<s> obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere </s>', '<s> no this is serious </s>', '<s> now think of it </s>', '<s> he talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old air force one an old boeing 747 with the old engines and you know spewing stuff

and i’m not supposed to be using hair spray </s>', '<s> but think of it </s>', '<s> so obama’s always talking about the global warming that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem ok

subjects </s>', '<s> and that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out and i’m so proud of it cnn just came out with a poll a couple of i guess a week ago — 36 percent for trump second is 16 third is 14 then 12 </s>', '<s> so they’re way down </s>', '<s> but on the economy they give me 55 — 55 percent </s>', '<s> that’s with 16 people at the time </s>', '<s> on the budget i mean i

people </s>', '<s> and that’s — these are two so many </s>', '<s> and then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff right </s>', '<s> and all of a sudden people are coming over and i say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall </s>', '<s> we have to be progressive in our thinking </s>', '<s> when i say progressive i mean like smart </s>', '<s> i’m not talking progressive like a bernie sanders would say the guy want to tax you </s>', '<s> think of it </s>', '<s> think of it </s>', '<s> this guy wants to raise your

this poor chuck todd meet the press </s>', '<s> his show is dying and he keeps saying do it do it but i never liked it </s>', '<s> you know i just — he never treated me fairly </s>', '<s> so i do his

gotten a dose last night do you agree </s>', '<s> she had a tough night </s>', '<s> she had a tough one </s>', '<s> she had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant ok </s>', '<s> so hillary

but he doesn’t treat me right </s>', '<s> so he goes the clinton campaign said they’d most like to run against trump like i’m some kind of a sap </s>', '<s> so i call him and i say chuck let me explain something </s>', '<s> when they say they want to run against me that means they don’t want to run against me do you understand that </s>', '<s> do you understand it’s reverse psychology </s>', '<s> they say they want to run against me — first of all i’m winning and tied in the polls now and i haven’t even hit her yet </s>', '<s> but look at what happened to all the guys i hit </s>', '<s> they’re gonzo they’re gone or they’re failing badly ok and they’ll be gone soon </s>', '<s> but hillary clinton — think of it </s>', '<s> i say so chuck report it like properly </s>', '<s> trust me

run for president </s>', '<s> macy’s nbc serta and nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country

what about the republican establishment </s>', '<s> the establishment’s got a problem you know </s>', '<s> it’s sort of like the fighters </s>', '<s> you know the great champions </s>', '<s> sometimes

100 got the money </s>', '<s> all certified checks </s>', '<s> if anyone wants to see the certified checks </s>', '<s> but rather than say why don’t you – could i see a certified check </s>', '<s> they said well they didn’t say they got the money </s>', '<s> they all got the money </s>', '<s> but they’re not people that always talk to the press </s>', '<s> many of them do talk to the press

other people are coming in </s>', '<s> ready </s>', '<s> 22kill got 200000 </s>', '<s> now these are checks that have been delivered that have been cashed that are now being used to help the vets

didn’t think they treated me right but actually they’ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months i have to say that about fox </s>', '<s> but when i didn’t do that one event the debate i gave a speech </s>', '<s> i didn’t have to do this with the money for the vets but i decided to because i thought it would be a good idea </s>', '<s> and i had some very generous people – carl icahn gave 500000 </s>', '<s> phil ruffin gave 1 millionike perlmutter gave 1 million </s>', '<s> we raised a lot of money </s>', '<s> and i didn’t have to do that </s>', '<s> it would have been easier just to give the speech </s>', '<s> and the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it not to give money to different things because it’s a lot easier actually that way </s>', '<s> and i believe we’re going to have some more coming in </s>', '<s> some friends of mine some more coming in </s>', '<s> and that adds up to 5600000 total and we’re going to have some more coming in </s>', '<s> now every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they’re getting a final approval from the government </s>', '<s> but every one of those has been passed </s>', '<s> this is my check for 1 million </s>', '<s> we have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn’t ask – i didn’t ask people to be here today </s>', '<s> i could have asked every one of the group unlike hillary who asks people to stand outside and say donald trump didn’t give the money </s>', '<s> nobody gave this kind of money </s>', '<s> so i gave 5600000 </s>', '<s> more is coming in </s>', '<s> probably tops the 6 million number </s>', '<s> i never thought we were going to raise 1 million when we started </s>', '<s> and we end up doing almost 6 million </s>', '<s> i have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair </s>', '<s> a lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money </s>', '<s> and i just want to thank all of those people </s>', '<s> i wasn’t too involved in picking the organizations other than to the marine law enforcement </s>', '<s> they are fabulous people </s>', '<s> they honored me last year at the waldorf astoria </s>', '<s> i knew them </s>', '<s> i was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn’t vet them quickly </s>', '<s> and so i gave it to the marine </s>', '<s> and if you look at number the marine corps law enforcement foundation is a fabulous group and i didn’t have to go through a big vetting process with them </s>', '<s> because i was going to split the 1 million check up amongstand in the end i just didn’t want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups </s>', '<s> because i wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart </s>', '<s> i didn’t want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going where did it go </s>', '<s> who did it go to </s>', '<s> then we said who it went to then we said how much was it </s>', '<s> look when this startedi said if we could raise 1 million that would be good </s>', '<s> and we ended up raising almost 6 million </s>', '<s> and i’m going to have more coming in over a period of time </s>', '<s> i’m totally accountable but i didn’t want to have credit for it </s>', '<s> actually though what i got was worse than credit because they were questioning me </s>', '<s> and this is money </s>', '<s> and by the way most of that money went out very early just so you understand </s>', '<s> but a lot of these groups – getting vetted by you know when you pay the money out they need government documentation </s>', '<s> they need a lot of different things </s>', '<s> plus we want to find out who’s in the good group </s>', '<s> i had people – teams of people – reviewing statistics reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money </s>', '<s> we have given to groups that are unbelievable groups </s>', '<s> and honestly i wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters </s>', '<s> they are so happy </s>', '<s> and i’m happy to do it </s>', '<s> i didn’t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly </s>', '<s> well generally speaking that’s 100 true </s>', '<s> i like scrutiny </s>', '<s> but you know what </s>', '<s> when i raise money – excuse me excuse me i’ve watched you on television </s>', '<s> you’re a real beauty </s>', '<s> when i raise money for the veterans and it’s a massive amount of money – find out how much hillary clinton has given to the veterans – nothing </s>', '<s> and then i see a few guys standing out there </s>', '<s> they don’t even know what they’re there for </s>', '<s> they have no idea </s>', '<s> they’re there because hillary clinton’s campaign sent them </s>', '<s> and actually i think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with hillary clinton’s campaign which was interesting but i wasn’t surprised </s>', '<s> i don’t want the credit for it but i shouldn’t be lambasted </s>', '<s> and remember this so out of the almost 6 million that was raised not one penny did i take for administration cost </s>', '<s> that’s unheard of </s>', '<s> how else am i going to raise the money </s>', '<s> how else am i going to raise the money </s>', '<s> i would have given – just so you understand </s>', '<s> until i was criticized – so i’m the only one in the world that could raise almost 6 million for the veterans have uniform applause by the veterans’ groups and end up being criticized by the press </s>', '<s> yes i made a speech and during the speech i said let’s raise a little money for the vets </s>', '<s> it turned out to be a lot of money not a little money </s>', '<s> i thought if we could get to 1 million it would be great which it would have been </s>', '<s> that’s right </s>', '<s> i do raise millions </s>', '<s> no i don’t think so </s>', '<s> no i raised almost 6 million </s>', '<s> some of it didn’t come through </s>', '<s> but more money is coming through than didn’t come through </s>', '<s> the number probably is going to be – when we finish it probably going to be over the 6 million </s>', '<s> i don’t mind it coming from the oppositionwhat i do mind is when i raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over 5 million or close to 6 million </s>', '<s> so look here’s the story </s>', '<s> here’s the story </s>', '<s> i think and i’ve been dealing with the press a long time </s>', '<s> i think the political press is among the most dishonest people i’ve ever met i have to tell you that </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> but i think the political pressi think the political press – i see the stories and i see the way they’re attached </s>', '<s> for instance i went down this weekend to do rolling thunder </s>', '<s> i was invited </s>', '<s> i didn’t have anything to do with it </s>', '<s> we had a tremendous gathering of people – thousands – i don’t know how many thousands – but many thousands of people </s>', '<s> and i joked oh i thought we were going to go from the jefferson memorial to the – i was joking </s>', '<s> they said donald trump was disappointed </s>', '<s> everybody knew i was being sarcastic and joking </s>', '<s> they said some of them </s>', '<s> said donald trump was very disappointed that it didn’t go from jefferson to lincoln </s>', '<s> you know millions of people </s>', '<s> i was joking </s>', '<s> i said oh i’m used to watching it </s>', '<s> we had – i was joking </s>', '<s> so they put it down as serious </s>', '<s> they know i was joking </s>', '<s> i’ll give you another example </s>', '<s> we had a certain – same event – it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people </s>', '<s> i don’t know – 10000 15000 maybe 25000 </s>', '<s> i don’t know there was a lot of people </s>', '<s> plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along </s>', '<s> eugene washington a man i like actually wrote an article said there were 5000 people there </s>', '<s> there were many times that </s>', '<s> and you weren’t allowed to have any more people </s>', '<s> and all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way </s>', '<s> they were waving to me as i’m going </s>', '<s> but wait a minute </s>', '<s> the point is law enforcement – these people didn’t allow you to have any more people </s>', '<s> i had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had </s>', '<s> it was all cordoned off </s>', '<s> you weren’t allowed to have any more </s>', '<s> you weren’t allowed to have any more people than that </s>', '<s> so instead of saying trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd they said trump was disappointed because i didn’t have millions of people going from jefferson to washington </s>', '<s> i mean give me a break </s>', '<s> honestly it’s dishonest reporting </s>', '<s> well the veterans believe me </s>', '<s> let me tell you the veterans why they believe </s>', '<s> and i have group that i gaveinvites a veteran to speak i could have asked all these groups – he just showed up </s>', '<s> i just saw him </s>', '<s> but i could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made – i didn’t want to do that </s>', '<s> i’m not looking for credit </s>', '<s> but what i don’t want is when i raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from abc – he’s a sleaze in my book </s>', '<s> you’re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well </s>', '<s> veteran thank you mr trump </s>', '<s> first of all for the record i’m a state representative from new hampshire 10 years on the veterans affairs committee 22 years in

scammers out there </s>', '<s> he did the right thing by vetting these groups there </s>', '<s> if you look at some of the groups they’re given 20 cents 40 cents on the dollar and they’re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips </s>', '<s> he gave 100 </s>', '<s> the liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation </s>', '<s> all right </s>', '<s> i’m a former

with a heart </s>', '<s> you’re all focused on the way he’s raising money and you’re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday </s>', '<s> you’re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists </s>', '<s> look at his plans on his trump website </s>', '<s> he talks about medical cards </s>', '<s> he talks about fixing the va </s>', '<s> he talks about competition </s>', '<s> i think the liberal media and i’ve been dealing with you a long time </s>', '<s> you need to get your head out of your butt </s>', '<s> focus on the real issues </s>', '<s> thank you </s>', '<s> what i did – i didn’t ask al </s>', '<s> i’ve gotten to know al a little bit primarily through new hampshire where we had great victories </s>', '<s> but he showed up this

me </s>', '<s> other groups received 200000 250000 </s>', '<s> they didn’t know what it was for </s>', '<s> and again upstairs i have received phones calls with people crying </s>', '<s> i have received letters – heartfelt letters </s>', '<s> the bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore </s>', '<s> because why should you raise 56 million and i think i’ll go over 6 million pretty easily </s>', '<s> nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than 1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building </s>', '<s> but nobody talks about that </s>', '<s> so we raised 56 million </s>', '<s> we have so many happy groups </s>', '<s> so many happy veterans </s>', '<s> and then i see these hillary clinton people outside </s>', '<s> now of course they don’t know the extent </s>', '<s> they probably figured based on reading the press that trump didn’t make you know didn’t raise

of veterans </s>', '<s> i don’t want to send a 250000 check to a group that doesn’t do good work </s>', '<s> so it’s called vetting </s>', '<s> we vet the vets </s>', '<s> but it’s called vetting </s>', '<s> i think it’s bothersome because i love the vets and i’ve worked hard for the vets </s>', '<s> and as you can see i’ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets </s>',

the way it’s supposed to be </s>', '<s> and it’s great </s>', '<s> and the reason i tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the united states </s>', '<s> we need that kind

you saw that horrible budget </s>', '<s> horrible horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that’s going to lift it </s>', '<s> and so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which i love and new ones came out today and i’ll tell you right now </s>', '<s> you know now that we’re at it </s>', '<s> and they came out some brand new ones – some beauties </s>', '<s> and one’s coming out – i guess a big one’s coming out </s>', '<s> i don’t know exactly what it is but it’s got to be pretty good because i see the response </s>', '<s> i mean even this with all the people still trying to come into this building </s>', '<s> somebody said it’s a barn </s>', '<s> this is a very nice barn actually </s>', '<s> but with all of the people still trying to

'<s> so it’s very special to me </s>', '<s> but then the polls came out and some of them – as an example – national polls 38 for trump 20 for second </s>', '<s> i wouldn’t even names </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> i won’t even mention names </s>', '<s> i’m going to be non-confrontational today for a change </s>', '<s> 21 for the second </s>', '<s> 11 </s>', '<s> and then they’re all down </s>', '<s> some of them are actually at 0 and 1 </s>', '<s> i don’t know </s>', '<s> jeb – well you know jeb’s got one problem </s>', '<s> he loves common core meaning he wants your kids educated from washington

they come as an act of love </s>', '<s> so i think those are two very bad points frankly </s>', '<s> so south carolina just came out and that’s 32 for trump 18 for second 11 for third </s>', '<s> great </s>', '<s> florida leading by a lot – 31 19 13 and then all down in the dumps </s>', '<s> georgia just came out </s>', '<s> i have 33 </s>', '<s> yeah don’t forget that’s 33 </s>', '<s> hard to believe </s>', '<s> that’s with 14 people 15 people </s>', '<s> i don’t know when they took it but it was recent </s>', '<s> 33 </s>', '<s> connecticut – now tom brady loves me and that’s sort of like

then you know they sort of phase out </s>', '<s> you ever hear of a place called iowa </s>', '<s> oh i love this </s>', '<s> we’re doing actually great </s>', '<s> first of all i have to tell you </s>', '<s> you know they never report it </s>', '<s> even cnn doesn’t report it </s>', '<s> cnn does a poll probably spent millions they never report their poll </s>', '<s> the cnn poll was 33 for trump 20 for chris </s>', '<s> nobody talks about it </s>', '<s> nobody talks about it </s>', '<s> they don’t talk about it </s>', '<s> they talk about – cnn is reporting other people’s polls </s>', '<s> so i call up </s>', '<s> i say wait a minute </s>', '<s> you’re cnn </s>', '<s> you spent a fortune on polls and you don’t report your own polls because i’m winning by a lot </s>', '<s> and they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls </s>', '<s> but we’re doing well </s>', '<s> i think we’re doing a lot better than anyone knows </s>', '<s> gravis just came out – 34 for trump 28 for cruz </s>', '<s> ppp 28 for trump 26 for cruz </s>', '<s> in other words it’s a little close here </s>', '<s> quinnipiac poll – very respected 31 for trump 29 for cruz </s>', '<s> and then again cnn 33 to 20 </s>', '<s> so we’re – i think we’re doing good </s>', '<s> i think we’re actually doing better than the polls </s>', '<s> now i could do this </s>', '<s> i could say well i just want to do well in iowa </s>', '<s> i want to win iowa folks </s>', '<s> because look i love the people </s>', '<s> the evangelicals have been phenomenal </s>', '<s> i’m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide i’m winning with evangelical – i don’t know if you know that – by a lot nationwide </s>', '<s> with iowa i’m doing really well with the evangelicals </s>', '<s> we’re doing really well with the tea party </s>', '<s> we’re doing well – i mean you hear the numbers </s>', '<s> i mean these are the numbers </s>', '<s> but i actually think we’re doing even better than the polls </s>', '<s> and you know there’s the thing that a lot of people said you know they call up are you going to vote for trump </s>', '<s> he’s got very very tough immigration policies </s>', '<s> he wants to destroy obamacare and replace it with something a lot better </s>', '<s> i’m going to do that </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> but you know a lot of people they’ll pick up the phone and they’ll hear different things and they’ll say uh no i’ll vote for – and then they’d get in the booth and they say trump is my man </s>', '<s> there are a lot of people saying that we’re going to do a lot better </s>', '<s> but we’ll see because feb 1st you have to get to caucus you have to go out </s>', '<s> you’ve got to do it </s>', '<s> otherwise we’ve all wasted our time </s>', '<s> you know one of the groups in maine and it was like incredible </s>', '<s> we were in different places up in new england recently and new hampshire was amazing </s>', '<s> and the people are standing there </s>', '<s> it was so cold </s>', '<s> there was one little group of – despite global warming – you know you hear about it was so cold </s>', '<s> it was windchill below zero </s>', '<s> and people were standing outside for hours trying to get in </s>', '<s> and then you hear the announcers </s>', '<s> well will they show up to vote </s>', '<s> and i don’t know much but i say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn’t believe in tennessee in texas where we had 21000 people no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they’ll stand for hours and hours to get in </s>', '<s> why aren’t they going to go and vote </s>', '<s> or in your case caucus </s>', '<s> why aren’t they going to go and vote </s>', '<s> it’s sort of an amazing thing </s>', '<s> so we think they’re going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote </s>', '<s> now yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different </s>', '<s> it’s a very interesting system </s>', '<s> but it is different </s>', '<s> here’s what i have to say about iowa </s>', '<s> it’s very important </s>', '<s> so you know there’s a movement to move iowa to the back of the pack </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> you know that </s>', '<s> you’ll still see me but you won’t see other people </s>', '<s> believe me </s>', '<s> i’m loyal </s>', '<s> to a fault i’m loyal </s>', '<s> but you’re going to see </s>', '<s> i give you

</s>', '<s> and they’re not moving new hampshire either because they’re talking about iowa new hampshire </s>', '<s> they’re not touching new hampshire </s>', '<s> so we’re going to just keep it the way it is </s>', '<s> it really is </s>', '<s> it’s an amazing </s>', '<s> first of all you’re amazing people </s>', '<s> but all over the country it’s a movement all over the country </s>', '<s> the people are incredible </s>', '<s> they want to make america great again </s>', '<s> they’re going to do something that’s special </s>', '<s> and you know we used to talk silent majority </s>', '<s> i say it’s the noisy majority because it’s actually a noisy majority </s>', '<s> it’s not a silent majority </s>', '<s> but people are fed up </s>', '<s> so i started on june 16th and we did well </s>', '<s> practically from the beginning we went up </s>', '<s> and if you remember we started at nothing </s>', '<s> you know we started at nothing because nobody believed i was going to run </s>', '<s> even when they – my wife said you know if you run you’re going to win </s>', '<s> i said what do you mean </s>', '<s> she said people don’t believe you’re going to run </s>', '<s> at the polls </s>', '<s> i was getting these little polls </s>', '<s> i felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors they get these little polls </s>', '<s> jeb again right </s>', '<s> boy he’s taking a lot of abuse </s>', '<s> you know </s>', '<s> i told him you know what </s>', '<s> you should use the name bush </s>', '<s> what’s wrong </s>', '<s> use the name bush </s>', '<s> i mean maybe it’s

pundits – these real geniuses back here – some of them are sitting back here – these real geniuses like george will with the little glasses – take away the glasses </s>', '<s> he looks like a dumb guy i’m telling you </s>', '<s> but each time these geniuses would say well he’s reached his plateau </s>', '<s> he’s plateaued at 6 right </s>', '<s> then it goes to 11 </s>', '<s> well you know this is surprising but he’s reached his plateau </s>', '<s> and then it goes to 18 </s>', '<s> and then it went to 22 24 28 then it went to 32 </s>', '<s> then it went actually 42 in the gravis poll and in

14 people that’s pretty good </s>', '<s> but they kept saying he’s plateaued </s>', '<s> that’s all he’ll get </s>', '<s> he’s got these followers </s>', '<s> we have the smartest followers there are

deal where we’re paying 150 billion and they give us the five back but they don’t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means </s>', '<s> that’s not a good sign </s>', '<s> but they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the interpol </s>', '<s> these are bad dudes </s>', '<s> they get 14 plus seven so they’re getting 21 people </s>', '<s> and they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint </s>', '<s> right to do oil </s>', '<s> right to do whatever they want </s>', '<s> but what do they also get out of that deal </s>', '<s> first of all they’re going to get nuclear </s>', '<s> they don’t have to develop nuclear missiles </s>', '<s> they can buy them </s>', '<s> for the kind of money we gave them they’re going to buy them

went up 11 points </s>', '<s> i don’t want to do it for that reason </s>', '<s> but it went up because people want strength just like having the family of john wayne who was great </s>', '<s> i love

that don’t know the first thing about the word negotiation </s>', '<s> i can take anybody in this office believe me and they’re better than obama and they’re better than kerry and they’re better than the foolish people – the foolish people </s>', '<s> it’s so embarrassing when you see what happens </s>', '<s> sergeant bergdahl all right </s>', '<s> sergeant bergdahl – we get a traitor they get five of the greatest killers that they’ve wanted for nine years </s>', '<s> you know the deal was five for one </s>', '<s> and they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal </s>', '<s> you know about sergeant bergdahl </s>', '<s> he deserted </s>', '<s> six people were killed trying to get him back </s>', '<s> they were looking for him </s>', '<s> the general and the colonel went to see all those people they said no he deserted </s>', '<s> he was a traitor </s>', '<s> and we still made the deal </s>', '<s> so we get a traitor </s>', '<s> we can give him back </s>', '<s> do you want to re-negotiate deals </s>', '<s> some of us will re-negotiate deals </s>', '<s> i would say about 999 – is there anybody that doesn’t re-negotiate deals in this room </s>', '<s> this room negotiates so i want to re-negotiate – perhaps more than any room than i’ve ever spoken </s>', '<s> maybe more </s>', '<s> it’s okay </s>', '<s> i’ve been called on that a couple of times too </s>', '<s> but the fact is i want to renegotiate that deal </s>', '<s> i want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from </s>', '<s> the hell – they can have him even if we don’t get the five guys back

going to win </s>', '<s> i mean unless something happens you know walk across the street the wrong thing happens </s>', '<s> but i’ll tell you what i have a great secret service </s>', '<s> here’s a

going to work in the budget </s>', '<s> it’s all about that </s>', '<s> what happens is they’re going to do budgets like we’re going to do this and that and i tell this story – then they walk into the

let’s take some questions </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> good </s>', '<s> …i’m going to go there right after this </s>', '<s> i have to go through – you know you have to watch to make sure that the

it’s so important i don’t mention my projects </s>', '<s> it’s not like very important to me anymore </s>', '<s> what’s really important to me is the united states and making it great again </s>', '<s> my theme is make america great again </s>', '<s> i mean it’s taken off like crazy </s>', '<s> the hats – it’s going crazy </s>', '<s> but you know some of these guys try to copy it but i had it trademarked because we’re smart </s>', '<s> a couple of them got up </s>', '<s> no you see i was making this speech and everybody stood up – make america great again… but nobody stood up to them </s>', '<s> but we sent them a little notice – don’t use that term </s>', '<s> we’re trademarked </s>', '<s> can you imagine i got the approval </s>', '<s> but we are – we’re building a great hotel down the road </s>', '<s> i hope you all stay and it’s going to be wonderful… …so i was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from ap and they did a very good job </s>', '<s> very fair story </s>', '<s> and one of the questions was about israel and the palestinians what’s going to happen </s>', '<s> i said – i used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make…can we think of any deals </s>', '<s> we all have tough deals right </s>', '<s> you know we have some good some bad… but i said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other </s>', '<s> i believe – because i’m a dealmaker – i believe that i can put both sides together </s>', '<s> but i said it’ll take six months </s>', '<s> at the end of six months and maybe sooner – with us we have a deal instinct </s>', '<s> a lot of us </s>', '<s> and you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you’re going to make a deal </s>', '<s> i will know very quickly whether or not i’ll be able to put that deal together </s>', '<s> i used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together </s>', '<s> there’s probably no tougher deal </s>', '<s> if i could do that it would make me so happy because there’s so much violence so much death and just been going on for so many years

</s>', '<s> with that being said you know i have a good chance of winning because you look at what’s going on </s>', '<s> so i have a good chance </s>', '<s> i don’t like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how i feel about this or that </s>', '<s> i’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room </s>', '<s> i don’t want one side or the other saying </s>', '<s> look i think people know where i stand </s>', '<s> but wouldn’t it be great if they could make a deal </s>', '<s> but a lasting deal a real deal </s>', '<s> not a phony deal that’s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again </s>', '<s> i’d love to – and i will give it </s>', '<s> you know obama as you know he said it won’t happen meaning he gave up on this before it even started </s>', '<s> but i think it would be a great thing for israel – i think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made and i’m going to give it my best </s>', '<s> i’m a great dealmaker </s>', '<s> that’s what i do </s>', '<s> i made a lot of money </s>', '<s> i’m going to give it my best </s>', '<s> it would be great if that deal could be made </s>', '<s> … by the way israel has given a lot…and a lot of people don’t know that </s>', '<s> i think the public relations for israel hasn’t been so great because israel’s given a lot but hasn’t been given a lot of credit for what they’ve given… in fact some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in israel </s>', '<s> there were things given </s>', '<s> but i’d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let’s go everybody’s even we love everybody and let’s see if we could do something </s>', '<s> but i do think this – and i do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons i’m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that israel has given a lot </s>', '<s> i don’t know whether or not they want to go that

will say that </s>', '<s> so that’s it </s>', '<s> you know what i want to do </s>', '<s> i want to wait until i meet with bibi </s>', '<s> you know i’m leaving for israel in a very short period of time </s>', '<s> i know </s>', '<s> i know what you’re saying </s>', '<s> i just – you’re not going to be – who’s the wise guy </s>', '<s> do me a favor </s>', '<s> just relax </s>', '<s> okay </s>',

it’s going to be fine </s>', '<s> but again you can’t go in with that – if you’re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal – you can’t go in with the attitude we’re going to shove it down

worry about it </s>', '<s> i think he’s a very good man </s>', '<s> i think he’s been treated very badly </s>', '<s> i think that our president has been unbelievably rude to bibi </s>', '<s> i don’t

out </s>', '<s> it’s going to be straightened out tough and it’s going to be straightened out fast </s>', '<s> the one bad thing is if i get in the 150 billion is gone </s>', '<s> that hurts me and

we’ll see </s>', '<s> we’re very different people </s>', '<s> we have very different qualities and we are extremely different </s>', '<s> and i’m different from all of the other candidates </s>', '<s> look nobody can negotiate trade deals like me </s>', '<s> we are going to take the 400 billion a year that we’re losing with china that’s going to be turned around </s>', '<s> the 75 billion a year

get rid of </s>', '<s> it actually works </s>', '<s> you get rid of the fraud waste and abuse </s>', '<s> it works </s>', '<s> so when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of medicare i don’t know how he stays here </s>', '<s> no i think that really marco is over-rated </s>', '<s> and frankly had bush been a better messenger he has the better message </s>', '<s> i mean if that was me

marco’s going to be hurt very badly </s>', '<s> and if you look at mr singer you have to see where mr singer is coming from and when you see where he’s coming from i think people are going to say whoa

florida all the time </s>', '<s> and for years i’ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster </s>', '<s> i would think that when you take a look at it you would find that </s>', '<s> but his

'<s> …i’ll tell you what </s>', '<s> on the debates it’s very interesting </s>', '<s> because i don’t really care that much </s>', '<s> i want a room </s>', '<s> i want a podium </s>', '<s> and let’s get going </s>', '<s> because i don’t really care that much </s>', '<s> but a lot of the people that are candidates who i respect – many of them not all of them – but i respect many of them they felt it was very unfair because hillary clinton was given all soft balls </s>', '<s> i mean she wasn’t asked one tough question </s>', '<s> they didn’t talk about her foundation </s>', '<s> they didn’t talk about any of the problems </s>', '<s> they didn’t talk about the emails </s>', '<s> when the email problem came up bernie sanders lost his whole campaign </s>', '<s> i mean what he did was so

going to his rallies anymore </s>', '<s> he’s finished </s>', '<s> so unless something happens to her with respect to the emails she’ll easily be the candidate </s>', '<s> but i will say this she only got softballs </s>', '<s> that’s all she got </s>', '<s> and if you look at the way we were treated it wasn’t the same way </s>', '<s> with that being said i don’t really care </s>', '<s> well i think the republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall </s>', '<s> they coalesced at that last debate because i mean it really started with me </s>', '<s> the guy asked me a question </s>', '<s> i think harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter </s>', '<s> he’s a disaster </s>', '<s> and he was – it was such as horribly put question and so obvious </s>', '<s> and the republicans coalesced around each other </s>', '<s> it was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it </s>', '<s> and all we want to do is to be treated fairly </s>', '<s> but with me i don’t care that much </s>', '<s> just give me a podium </s>', '<s> what i would say is this the networks have made a fortune because of me not because of anybody else </s>', '<s> you know they were saying that the last cycle they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn’t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> nobody wanted to watch </s>', '<s> now they have 25 million people 24 million people 23 million people and 16 million people </s>', '<s> i mean give me a break </s>', '<s> so somebody said how did they get there </s>', '<s> and actually variety and hollywood reporter who do report this stuff pretty well – much better than the political press – they said solely for one reason – it was trump </s>', '<s> i’ll take the credit </s>', '<s> but i’ll tell you what i also want </s>', '<s> i think that wounded warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates – enormous profits – by the way beyond anything they’ve ever envisioned </s>', '<s> cnn was going to get 2000 for a 30 second ad </s>', '<s> they ended up getting 250000 </s>', '<s> so they went from 2000 to 250000 for a 30 second ad </s>', '<s> the networks and the cable are making a fortune and i think they should give some of the profits to the wounded warriors and the veterans </s>', '<s> that’s what i want </s>', '<s> i’m giving them away </s>', '<s> i’m giving the profits of my book – i’m giving them away to a lot of different – including the vets </s>', '<s> …i have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women

because if you look at the devaluations of china of japan of many many different countries they’re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don’t have leaders that know

'<s> don’t you think </s>', '<s> leadership </s>', '<s> i mean when leadership is number one – they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot </s>', '<s> so you know it’s great

'<s> how many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics </s>', '<s> the bottom line is we want results </s>', '<s> we want to get it done </s>', '<s> but when you’re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you’re talking about immigration and you’re talking about the wall because we’re going to have a wall and we’re going to stop illegal

have to tell you legal – you come in and we’re going to have a good time and you’re going to be there and you’re going to do great – and visas – maybe work maybe there are cases where you need people

that’s the end of that </s>', '<s> but i want to tell you will you – i refuse to say get your asses in gear </s>', '<s> i will not say that </s>', '<s> i will not say it </s>', '<s> i will not say it

but i do mean it </s>', '<s> i’m going to stay here </s>', '<s> we’re going to work really hard </s>', '<s> when i heard the poll today they said what are you going to do </s>', '<s> i said i’m going to work harder in iowa </s>', '<s> i’m not leaving iowa </s>', '<s> i’m not leaving iowa </s>', '<s> now if i lose iowa i will never speak to you people again </s>', '<s> that i can tell you </s>', '<s> okay let’s do a couple of questions </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> come on </s>', '<s> …you know we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country </s>', '<s> now you look like you’re doing pretty well in all fairness </s>', '<s> but still we have 50 million </s>', '<s> we have 46 million people and they’re getting food stamps </s>', '<s> 46 million </s>', '<s> think of it </s>', '<s> you know we talk about how well we’re doing </s>', '<s> so we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty food stamps and it’s got to end </s>', '<s> one of the problems – we don’t have enough jobs in this country </s>', '<s> it’s very simple </s>', '<s> you know it’s so simple when you think about it </s>', '<s> our jobs have been taken away </s>', '<s> and i’ll tell you what else middle income folks – their salaries haven’t gone up in 12 years </s>', '<s> people are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago </s>', '<s> and other things have gone up </s>', '<s> so they’re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago </s>', '<s> but that’s an amazing stat </s>', '<s> but people – one of the reasons they say i’m doing so well because i let people know we’re going to bring jobs back </s>', '<s> we’re going to bring industry and plants </s>', '<s> we’re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that </s>', '<s> we’re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they’re working </s>', '<s> then the other thing you have a lot of part-time jobs </s>', '<s> i have some people that i know very well and they’ve had a job for 20 years at the same place </s>', '<s> all of a sudden they’re working part-time because of obamacare because from an accounting standpoint it just works better </s>', '<s> they love the owners the stores and things </s>', '<s> they love the owners they think the owners are great </s>', '<s> but the owners are forced to make part-time jobs they have part-time jobs </s>', '<s> they work all their life </s>', '<s> they have a wonderful company that they’re working for and now all of a sudden they’re cut into part-time jobs because of obamacare because of the rulings of obamacare </s>', '<s> and you all know what i’m talking about </s>', '<s> so they end up being part-time workers and they don’t want to be part-time workers </s>', '<s> they don’t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker </s>', '<s> and we’re not going to have that stuff anymore </s>', '<s> we’re not going to have it any more </s>', '<s> we’re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up </s>', '<s> believe me </s>', '<s> the numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that’s a shame …tell you what as president i can guarantee it </s>', '<s> as trump i can say i’ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won’t stop </s>', '<s> it’ll be easier to take todd and just say look we’re going to work with you todd </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> so will you get me that number and everything and we’ll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here </s>', '<s> you have problems with the va also huh </s>', '<s> terrible </s>', '<s> i hear only – i just hear terrible </s>', '<s> and we’re going to solve that problem </s>', '<s> you know it can be solved </s>', '<s> the waits now for the va are longer than they’ve ever been…the waits now are worse than they’ve ever been </s>', '<s> thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor </s>', '<s> okay dying </s>', '<s> and you find the same thing you say </s>', '<s> you have to use your own because they won’t do anything </s>', '<s> so we’re going to take care of our vets and we’re going to take care of the va and it’s going to be one of the things we’re going to be releasing pretty soon </s>', '<s> but one of the things we’re going to do with the va we have a lot of hospitals that aren’t doing any business </s>', '<s> we have a lot of private doctors that could do more business </s>', '<s> we’re losing a lot of our doctors because of obamacare </s>', '<s> they’re retiring </s>', '<s> they’re leaving </s>', '<s> one of them – a friend of mine – said i have more nurses working for me now more than before but i have more accountants and the end result is a disaster he’s getting out of the business </s>', '<s> he’s got nurses but he’s got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy </s>', '<s> so one of the things we’re going to do is if todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait – because the waits are unbelievable – 5 6 7 days sometimes </s>', '<s> they’re going to a private doctor </s>', '<s> they’re going to go to a private hospital </s>', '<s> or a public hospital that’s in the area </s>', '<s> and we’re going to pay for that and it’s going to cost less money – it’s going to cost less money than the system we have now – and you’re going to end up getting much better care </s>', '<s> it’s going to cost less and you’re going to get better care… so the keystone pipeline first of all i’d approve it because it’s thousands of jobs </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> i would approve it so fast so fast </s>', '<s> and hillary should have approved it </s>', '<s> you know hillary wanted to approve it but she’s been dragged so far left that’s she’s – forget it </s>', '<s> it’s a disaster </s>', '<s> so i would approve it </s>', '<s> but with that being said i may want to make a better deal because you know what </s>', '<s> we’re bringing oil from canada </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> i may say i want 10 </s>', '<s> we’re going to approve it but i want 10 15 </s>', '<s> because the truth is that the keystone pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years we have so much energy </s>', '<s> and it’s great stuff </s>', '<s> we have really great quality higher than canada </s>', '<s> you know they have the tar sands which is a problem for them </s>', '<s> very expensive to get it out </s>', '<s> we have great stuff </s>', '<s> so i would approve it because i love the jobs of building it </s>', '<s> i love the jobs of building it </s>', '<s> but i may just say maybe we should get 10 15 maybe 20 as that oil flows through our land </s>', '<s> you know maybe we should do that </s>', '<s> so i’m going to look into that </s>', '<s> but when i approve it – i’ll tell you what when i approve it it’ll be a great deal for the united states </s>', '<s> it won’t be like – because right now what we’re doing is we’re approving it we’re not really getting anything </s>', '<s> they’re putting it underground and that’s actually good environmentally </s>', '<s> better than having trucks going down the road and everything else </s>', '<s> that’s good environmentally </s>', '<s> but we’re not getting – we’re not getting – anything much for it </s>', '<s> when i get finished with the keystone they’ll be happy and we’ll be happy </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> well i’ll tell you in all fairness ben carson said yesterday or the other day that he wants to abolish medicare </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> and you know what a disaster that is </s>', '<s> now i’m sure at some point he’ll take it back </s>', '<s> but he said he wants to abolish medicare and one thing people do like their medicare they do like it </s>', '<s> and you are bringing up a point that i’ve heard before </s>', '<s> we’re going to look at a lot of different things </s>', '<s> but we’re going to save social security we’re going to save medicare and that’s the way it is </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> we’re not abolishing like other people </s>', '<s> okay it’s a lot of people but you know what </s>', '<s> it’s costing us 200 billion a year immigration in this country right now </s>', '<s> and dwight eisenhower is going to say he moved 15 million in the 1950s early 1950s moved them out </s>', '<s> we have tremendous illegal immigration problems </s>', '<s> dwight eisenhower nice guy he moved 15 million people out of the united states </s>', '<s> and you know what happened </s>', '<s> he moved them right across the border

they moved them all the way south – all the way south – and they didn’t come back </s>', '<s> now we have to do it </s>', '<s> we have no choice </s>', '<s> we either have a country or we don’t </s>', '<s> and i want them to come back </s>', '<s> but i want them to come back with papers </s>', '<s> i want them to come back legally </s>', '<s> i want them to come back </s>', '<s> the good ones </s>', '<s> the good ones </s>', '<s> but only the good ones </s>', '<s> we got some bad ones </s>', '<s> remember the heat i took with illegal immigration </s>', '<s> remember that heat </s>', '<s> for two weeks </s>', '<s> rush limbaugh said he has received more incoming than any human being i’ve ever seen </s>', '<s> and then he double-downed… you know what </s>', '<s> i took a lot of heat and then you had kate in san francisco killed shot in the back and so many others </s>', '<s> and people started looking </s>', '<s> and let me tell you we have some wonderful people over here and they’re here illegally but they’re wonderful people </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> and we’ll try to get them back real soon and we’ll do it through a legal process </s>', '<s> but we also have some really bad gang members </s>', '<s> you know some of the gangs in la </s>', '<s> they’re made up of illegal immigrants </s>', '<s> and we have unbelievable police forces that don’t get the respect that they should get </s>', '<s> they don’t get it </s>', '<s> i mean what they go through it’s unbelievable </s>', '<s> they’re afraid to talk to anybody </s>', '<s> they don’t want to lose their jobs </s>',

couple of bad apples </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> i don’t know who they are or where they are but you do </s>', '<s> probably mostly back there in the press </s>', '<s> but the police do an unbelievable job </s>', '<s> and they know the gangs </s>', '<s> you go to la the la cops </s>', '<s> you got chicago the chicago cops </s>', '<s> these people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs </s>', '<s> but they’re not allowed to do their jobs </s>', '<s> and we’re going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they’re not coming back and i don’t want to put them in our jails because i don’t want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years </s>', '<s> i don’t want them in our jails </s>', '<s> we have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails </s>', '<s> i don’t want them in our jails </s>', '<s> i heard a couple of these candidates saying well they’re – they’re such babies </s>', '<s> but you know what </s>', '<s> they’re talking about putting them in jail </s>', '<s> well i don’t want them </s>', '<s> our jails are over-brimming </s>', '<s> i want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be

good thing about an executive order in the first minute in office i will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders </s>', '<s> they’ll be revoked </s>', '<s> the only good thing </s>', '<s> it’s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that’s the end of that </s>', '<s> so we’re going to clean up our border </s>', '<s> we’re going to make it fantastic </s>', '<s> we’re going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen </s>', '<s> we will support israel 1000 </s>', '<s> israel feels so

'<s> a new poll came out today where we’re over 30 </s>', '<s> we’ve actually hit numbers as high as 35 and 40 </s>', '<s> and frankly i’ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the democrats and very easily i think beat the democrats no matter who it may be whether it’s hillary or anybody else and i think maybe hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what’s happening getting to the starting gate the best way for the republicans to win is if i win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up </s>', '<s> and for that reason i have signed the pledge </s>', '<s> so i will be totally pledging my allegiance to the republican party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win </s>', '<s> we will win </s>', '<s> and most importantly we will make our country great again because that’s what it’s all about </s>', '<s> we have to make our country great again </s>', '<s> this is a self-funded campaign </s>', '<s> we have our heart in it </s>', '<s> we have our soul in it </s>', '<s> i don’t need money and i don’t want money </s>', '<s> and this is going to be a campaign like i think no other </s>', '<s> i’m not controlled by lobbyists </s>', '<s> i’m not controlled by anybody </s>', '<s> i’m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our

than the assurance that i would be treated fairly </s>', '<s> and i’ve seen that over the last two months </s>', '<s> they really have been very fair </s>', '<s> no i have no intention of changing my mind </s>', '<s> well i think the big thing that’s changed is – and it’s been obvious to all – number one after i announced we went up like a rocket ship </s>', '<s> nobody thought i was going to run and they said oh he won’t run and he won’t put in his papers </s>', '<s> and he wouldn’t do all of this </s>', '<s> i did that </s>', '<s> the papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular </s>', '<s> it’s a great company </s>', '<s> i built a great company </s>', '<s> and all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received </s>', '<s> and i think the thing that’s changed is the fact that i went to number one place very quickly after i signed and after i in this building notified everybody that i’d be running for president </s>', '<s> so i think the biggest thing is that i went early to number one and the rnc has treated me with great respect </s>', '<s> so that was very important </s>', '<s> no i see no circumstances under which i would tear up that pledge </s>', '<s> well you don’t have to be met when you’re at 2 </s>', '<s> it’s one of those things </s>', '<s> that’s the way life works </s>', '<s> and i like gov </s>', '<s> chris christie

assimilation takes </s>', '<s> and that’s how – i mean whether people like it or not that’s how we assimilate and that’s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage </s>', '<s> and that’s how people that don’t speak – and i’m not just talking about spanish i’m talking about from various parts of the world – that’s how they will become successful and do great </s>', '<s> so i think it’s more appropriate to be speaking english </s>', '<s> well one of the things i want to do and i feel very strongly it’s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws </s>', '<s> and when people come into the country illegally we should not allow that </s>', '<s> and this is not from south america </s>', '<s> this is not from mexico </s>', '<s> this is from all over the world </s>', '<s> when people come illegally we cannot allow that </s>', '<s> and i want people to come legally </s>', '<s> i want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess

been proven right </s>', '<s> and many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me which i very much appreciate </s>', '<s> of course they haven’t done it publicly but these are

…well i just want to tell you about nashville </s>', '<s> so years ago – many years ago – like i hate to say 40 but i won’t say 40 but close to 40 i came to nashville </s>', '<s> did you ever hear of a company called genesco </s>', '<s> genesco </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> so they were based in nashville tennessee and they owned the bonwit teller department store chain </s>', '<s> and i was a young guy and i came from brooklyn in queens and i wanted to go into manhattan </s>', '<s> and i went into manhattan and i did the grand hyatt hotel and i did some other things that were good </s>', '<s> but the thing i wanted more than anything was fifth avenue between 57th and 56th street which is called the tiffany location right next to tiffany </s>', '<s> and that’s what i wanted </s>', '<s> i wanted that piece of property so badly </s>', '<s> i shouldn’t say that because you’re not supposed to want things like that so badly </s>', '<s> god will get angry at me right </s>', '<s> but i wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was genesco based in nashville tennessee </s>', '<s> and i came in and i came to nashville and i met with the heads of genesco who were really great people actually </s>', '<s> and they were having a lot of difficulties </s>', '<s> there were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything </s>', '<s> and i convinced them to sell me the land and the building </s>', '<s> and i bought the bonwit teller store fifth avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding tiffany </s>', '<s> i bought all the air rights and then ultimately i bought the air rights from tiffany and i built trump tower </s>', '<s> and to this day it’s one of the great buildings of the world and it’s one of the great successes </s>', '<s> and i love country music and i went to the grand ole opry while i was here </s>', '<s> and i just had such an incredible experience </s>', '<s> and when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places – you know when you’re leading in every poll they sort of want you </s>', '<s> when you’re not leading in the polls like so many of these guys they don’t want you at all </s>', '<s> and we’ll talk about the polls in a second </s>', '<s> but i had a lot of choices for this morning and i guess i could have also gone and played golf like the president does all the time right </s>', '<s> but i decided let’s do this </s>', '<s> and i really chose nashville because the experience is one of my – it’s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it’s so important and it’s been such a great – from the day i built it it was a home run </s>', '<s> and it all really took place because of nashville tennessee </s>', '<s> so i really – it’s an honor to be with you folks i can tell you </s>', '<s> real honor </s>', '<s> so coming over i heard and i watched television – you know they have all these cameras back there and they’re live </s>', '<s> and i guess we’re live on cnn we’re live on so many different things </s>', '<s> it’s always difficult </s>', '<s> you know when you’re always live you’ve got to change up your speech </s>', '<s> you can’t make the speech over and over… the other candidates don’t get covered live ever except for the debate </s>', '<s> so you know they had 24 million people on the debate </s>', '<s> now they think when the new numbers come out they’ll be even substantially higher than that </s>', '<s> so i would’ve said they would have had a million or two </s>', '<s> so i say they have 24 million people </s>', '<s> and i say well now the second debate which is on cnn – that was on fox maybe i should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity </s>', '<s> does that make sense </s>', '<s> all to charity </s>', '<s> all to charity </s>', '<s> when i said that to the writers at time magazine they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story </s>', '<s> and i said you know and i sort of thought i said it off the record but they put it in time magazine </s>', '<s> so now – maybe should i ask for charity maybe a nice nashville charity and american cancer society and aids research – so many of this – there’s so many good – alzheimer’s – you know there’s so many things going on </s>', '<s> maybe i should ask for a lot of money or i’m not showing up </s>', '<s> you know it’s interesting </s>', '<s> so they’ll get 2 million – a million to 2 million people at the debates </s>', '<s> you know they’ve been doing them for a long time </s>', '<s> they don’t do great especially the early republican debate </s>', '<s> like you know the expression – it draws flies </s>', '<s> that’s what it draws </s>', '<s> so this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television </s>', '<s> i think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television </s>', '<s> naturally i took full credit for it which in all fairness i should </s>', '<s> i should </s>', '<s> so bottom line i think i might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know </s>', '<s> but i did say is it a little hokey if i do that </s>', '<s> maybe it’s not so nice </s>', '<s> so what do you think </s>', '<s> should i do it or not </s>', '<s> maybe not </s>', '<s> i don’t know </s>', '<s> here’s the thing </s>', '<s> if i don’t do it cnn just makes a lot of money </s>', '<s> i don’t care about cnn </s>', '<s> honestly </s>', '<s> no they’re going to make a lot of money </s>', '<s> they just shut off their camera </s>', '<s> they’re actually very nice </s>', '<s> but they’re going to make a lot of money and you know it’s something we should consider </s>', '<s> so we’ll all consider it together </s>', '<s> but coming over today i saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the dreamers having to do with children and you know the dreams of children </s>', '<s> and these are people who come over to the country and they’re dreamers </s>', '<s> and i said what about our children </s>', '<s> why can’t our children that are in the country why can’t they be the dreamers </s>', '<s> nobody ever talks about that </s>', '<s> no no nobody ever talks about that </s>', '<s> you know we talk about the dreamers we talk about illegal immigrants who by the way are treated better than our vets </s>', '<s> you know our vets are incredible </s>', '<s> no no the illegal immigrants in many cases…are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have – our wounded warriors are – these are the greatest people we have </s>', '<s> and another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say good morning ladies and gentlemen </s>', '<s> nashville it’s wonderful – you know is that i can sort of be very current </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> i can be very very current </s>', '<s> i can talk about what’s happening </s>', '<s> this morning on the television they had a whole story about the veterans administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in </s>', '<s> these are our veterans </s>', '<s> these are the people that got hurt fighting for us </s>', '<s> maybe we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them to be honest with you </s>', '<s> i mean that’s possible too </s>', '<s> they had a story this morning on fox on cnn and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there’s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there’s nobody there </s>', '<s> and the veterans – i don’t know probably some of you saw it the veterans are saying where are the people </s>', '<s> and then they said what happened </s>', '<s> and they said this happens all the time </s>', '<s> there was not even – nobody even there </s>', '<s> and two weeks ago on wednesday they had the longest wait in the history – in the history of the veterans administration for people wanting to see a doctor </s>', '<s> when i go to a doctor if i have to wait like 9 minutes i’m like get me – i’d go crazy </s>', '<s> it’s true </s>', '<s> remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> beada remembers that </s>', '<s> you’d have a cold </s>', '<s> the doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big beautiful little bag being at the top </s>', '<s> and he’d come over to your house check you out fine </s>', '<s> those days don’t exist anymore </s>', '<s> you know we’re in age of obamacare where nothing exists </s>', '<s> by the way we will repeal and replace obamacare </s>', '<s> that i can tell you </s>', '<s> that i can tell you </s>', '<s> but so two weeks ago wednesday the longest wait in the history of the veterans administration </s>', '<s> so that if you go to the doctor’s office men and women are waiting four days three days one was five days </s>', '<s> one case was five days or six days finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation </s>', '<s> now you think about that </s>', '<s> can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day </s>', '<s> but these people are waiting four five days </s>', '<s> so the wait’s now the longest in history and that’s the way we’re treating our greatest people and that’s not right and we’re going to change that </s>', '<s> we’re going to change that </s>', '<s> we have right now – and people don’t know this </s>', '<s> you know they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically </s>', '<s> all talk no action politicians </s>', '<s> and i mean on both sides in all fairness </s>', '<s> you know i’m a republican </s>', '<s> i’m a conservative </s>', '<s> but i’m just as angry with the republicans because they go to washington something happens – they become weak </s>', '<s> you know they go to washington – we’re going to stop obamacare </s>', '<s> we’re going to stop this </s>', '<s> we’re going to do this </s>', '<s> we’re going to do that </s>', '<s> then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings and they go oh i made it darling i made it </s>', '<s> i vote for you </s>', '<s> i vote for you </s>', '<s> i vote for obamacare expansions </s>', '<s> i’ll do whatever you want me to do </s>', '<s> i’m in washington </s>', '<s> it’s amazing </s>', '<s> isn’t it amazing </s>', '<s> don’t you agree </s>', '<s> i won’t happen to me i promise </s>', '<s> and if it does you can let me know about it </s>', '<s> but it won’t </s>', '<s> i promise </s>', '<s> i promise </s>', '<s> but you know they show those phony statistics where we’re 54 unemployment </s>', '<s> 54 </s>', '<s> the real number </s>', '<s> you know i actually saw a number it could be 42 okay believe it or not </s>', '<s> but when you think about it we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force </s>', '<s> 93 million people </s>', '<s> of the 93 many of these people want jobs </s>', '<s> and they quit looking </s>', '<s> so if you’re looking for a job and you can’t find it and you stop for a while – you know after a while you sort of like it’s not happening </s>', '<s> it’s not going to happen </s>', '<s> i don’t know what they do </s>', '<s> but they stop </s>', '<s> they are considered statistically employed </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> so we have 93 million people out of the labor force </s>', '<s> i mean think about it </s>', '<s> it’s hard to believe </s>', '<s> we have 50 million people in poverty </s>', '<s> these are very new numbers </s>', '<s> 50 million people in poverty </s>', '<s> taking our money </s>', '<s> japan’s taking our money </s>', '<s> mexico is beating us at the border and on trade </s>', '<s> by the way they’re killing us on trade </s>', '<s> you know that </s>', '<s> in fact you just lost a big car plant to mexico in tennessee </s>', '<s> remember </s>', '<s> recently front page wall street journal </s>', '<s> a plant that you were going to have… comment on a supporter’s sign you know this is a movement folks </s>', '<s> this is not like maybe even about me </s>', '<s> i don’t want it to be about me </s>', '<s> this is about common sense </s>', '<s> it’s about doing the right thing </s>', '<s> one of the things that came out in the poll which was really amazing </s>', '<s> some of the polls i mean hey in iowa we’re leading big </s>', '<s> those are great people </s>', '<s> we just left iowa </s>', '<s> we had such an amazing evening </s>', '<s> 4000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening </s>', '<s> we just left alabama which was unbelievable </s>', '<s> 31000 people in a stadium and it was supposed to pour </s>', '<s> and it did </s>', '<s> it poured the minute my speech – that’s like luck </s>', '<s> that’s from god </s>', '<s> the minute the speech was over we got it and it poured </s>', '<s> we had 31000 people and it was the most unbelievable </s>', '<s> and the poll just came out in alabama leading big in alabama </s>', '<s> leading big in iowa </s>', '<s> leading tremendously big in new hampshire </s>', '<s> great people </s>', '<s> leading really big in new hampshire </s>', '<s> leading big in florida </s>', '<s> how about florida </s>', '<s> i have a governor </s>', '<s> we have a low energy governor and we have a senator and we’re leading big in florida </s>', '<s> how do you do that when you have a senator who’s sitting you have a governor who’s been there for eight years and trump – </s>', '<s> i love florida and i’m there a lot </s>', '<s> what could be in florida </s>', '<s> great weather </s>', '<s> you have great weather but florida has great weather </s>', '<s> big advantage </s>', '<s> but you know i’m leading big in florida </s>', '<s> but one of the polls came out because in south carolina and north carolina i’m leading really big </s>', '<s> and in south carolina a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability – you know i’m the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say – i think i had one poll where i’m 41 – almost 41 – can you imagine </s>', '<s> 41 </s>', '<s> there’s 17 people </s>', '<s> so i’m at 41 with 17 people and they said trump’s at 41 but look – you can’t even hear it </s>', '<s> you know trump says bleh </s>', '<s> nobody knows what they just said </s>', '<s> but there are some people that don’t like him </s>', '<s> it’s unbelievable </s>', '<s> i’m the only one that wins these polls and i get negative publicity </s>', '<s> no it’s incredible </s>', '<s> the press ayeyayay </s>', '<s> …well yesterday you might have seen me </s>', '<s> i was in south carolina </s>', '<s> i made a speech </s>', '<s> i had to bring it up </s>', '<s> the new york times to me is a big deal </s>', '<s> you know i’m from new york </s>', '<s> very liberal paper but that’s okay </s>', '<s> you know not everybody could be like us </s>', '<s> but it’s still the new york times </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> we have to admit still the new york times </s>', '<s> and i’m on the front page a lot on the new york times and to be on the front page of the new york times is a big deal </s>', '<s> but yesterday or two days ago they had story about me and they had some low level hispanic commentator </s>', '<s> low level guy </s>', '<s> this one didn’t like me </s>', '<s> by the way i think i’m going to win the hispanic vote and i think – you know in nevada i won the hispanic poll </s>', '<s> they love me </s>', '<s> i love the hispanic people </s>', '<s> incredible energy </s>', '<s> incredible people </s>', '<s> i love the people </s>', '<s> i have so many – i have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me </s>', '<s> they’re great people </s>', '<s> and i said i’m going to win </s>', '<s> and a lot of the hispanics that are here legally they don’t want people coming in illegally </s>', '<s> you know it’s true </s>', '<s> it’s true </s>', '<s> so there’s this poll that comes out </s>', '<s> i think it was in south carolina where we’re way up and lindsey at 4 and he’s the senator </s>', '<s> i’m at 30 </s>', '<s> so i wrote him a note congratulations </s>', '<s> i’m only beating you in your home state by 26 points </s>', '<s> so anyways who cares </s>', '<s> but they did something that nobody reported </s>', '<s> they say oh but do people like trump </s>', '<s> by the way this election is not going to be like </s>', '<s> i think i’m a nice person </s>', '<s> i love people </s>', '<s> i want to help people </s>', '<s> women’s health issues to me are very important </s>', '<s> to jeb bush it wasn’t important because he didn’t want to fund them </s>', '<s> and then he said oh i misspoke </s>', '<s> but you know i really want to be a nice person and i am a nice person </s>', '<s> but i think it’s actually going to be an election based on competence </s>', '<s> we’re tired of being like the patsy for everybody </s>', '<s> i really do </s>', '<s> i think it’s time </s>', '<s> but in the poll this was the monmouth poll </s>', '<s> big poll </s>', '<s> highly re – in another act of political magic…trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative – nobody wrote this by the way </s>', '<s> nobody said it </s>', '<s> nobody reported it </s>', '<s> from negative to positive </s>', '<s> this is an exact quote </s>', '<s> i have like this photographic memory so i don’t need – but i want to be sure because if i used the word the incorrectly they’ll say he didn’t – favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month </s>', '<s> a feat that monmouth university’s patrick murray’s highly respected pollster called astounding </s>', '<s> called it astounding </s>', '<s> nobody else wrote about it </s>', '<s> that defies any rule in presidential politics that i’ve ever seen said this highly respected man </s>', '<s> murray the director of the polling institute said he flipped it from 20 to 52 in one month and he said that he’s never seen that before </s>', '<s> and you know what </s>', '<s> that’s because people have heard me and they say you’re such a nice person </s>', '<s> no they want – they say he’s a man – i’ve made a tremendous amount of money </s>', '<s> i’ve had tremendous success </s>', '<s> and i don’t say that braggingly </s>', '<s> that’s the kind of thinking we need in the country </s>', '<s> i mean whatever it is </s>', '<s> but to me that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll </s>', '<s> we were much much higher more than double everybody </s>', '<s> and we are more than double everybody </s>', '<s> you saw the quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll </s>', '<s> i was the same thing </s>', '<s> much much higher – double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates </s>', '<s> and the reason is people in this country are smart </s>', '<s> they don’t believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people – you know why are they doing this </s>', '<s> i mean why are they even saying it </s>', '<s> you’d think that if somebody’s good for the country – and i’ll be great for the country because i’m going to make great deals for our country </s>', '<s> we don’t win anymore </s>', '<s> our country doesn’t win anymore </s>', '<s> you’d think somebody – even a liberal person or a democrat liberal and i mean really liberal </s>', '<s> somebody who’s going to make the country – why are they knocking it </s>', '<s> why are they knocking </s>', '<s> why do they fight </s>', '<s> you’d think they’d say let’s do it </s>', '<s> it’s good </s>', '<s> it’s good for all of us </s>', '<s> because our country is in trouble </s>', '<s> we owe now 19 trillion </s>', '<s> you know i’ve been saying 18 trillion for a while now </s>', '<s> but now it starts to go up quickly </s>', '<s> and by the way when obamacare kicks in which is really kicking in in ’16 you want to see bad deficits </s>', '<s> you want to see it go up </s>', '<s> you’re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs </s>', '<s> and it’s no good </s>', '<s> have you noticed – and you’ve seen it yourself – the premiums have gone through the roof </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> the deductibility – unless you’re close to death you’re never going to use it </s>', '<s> you can’t use it because the deductibility is so high </s>', '<s> but the premiums are up 30 40 and 50 and more </s>', '<s> it’s a disaster </s>', '<s> and on top of that it’s going to cost the country a fortune </s>', '<s> so it’s not only costing you a lot of money it’s going to cost the country a fortune </s>', '<s> so we have to do something about it </s>', '<s> and we have to do something importantly about it </s>', '<s> but when i see the people on television and i have to tell you i won’t mention names some of them when they hear my name – i was talking – we have a great reporter today from the wall street journal with us </s>', '<s> okay </s>', '<s> who came down </s>', '<s> and she actually said some of them when they hear your name it looks like they’re a boiler waiting to explode </s>', '<s> it’s true </s>', '<s> …now number one they look bad because they said – do you remember the beginning </s>', '<s> like three four months ago </s>', '<s> they said he’s a clown </s>', '<s> he’s a clown </s>', '<s> just having fun </s>', '<s> you know i went to a great school </s>', '<s> i did great </s>', '<s> i did – everything was great </s>', '<s> i came out </s>', '<s> i made a fortune which i want to use the brain for you but i made a fortune </s>', '<s> i then did a book called the art of the deal and many bestsellers </s>', '<s> the art of the deal being probably the best selling business book of all time </s>', '<s> who has read the art of the deal </s>', '<s> yeah most people </s>', '<s> most everybody </s>', '<s> i jokingly say but i mean it – the bible tops it by a long way </s>', '<s> i say that </s>', '<s> i say that </s>', '<s> said it the first time in iowa </s>', '<s> people liked that </s>', '<s> but it’s true </s>', '<s> nothing tops the bible </s>', '<s> but the art of the deal – great success </s>', '<s> many books – bestsellers </s>', '<s> many many bestsellers </s>', '<s> then i do the apprentice </s>', '<s> i’ve never done television </s>', '<s> i do the apprentice </s>', '<s> it’s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way </s>', '<s> and nbc renewed the apprentice </s>', '<s> you know that </s>', '<s> right </s>', '<s> for me </s>', '<s> they came up to my office the head of comcast – great guy – i won’t use names </s>', '<s> just say steve </s>', '<s> no honestly he’s a great guy </s>', '<s> one of the best in the country </s>', '<s> he came up with the heads of nbc six months ago and they said donald we’re renewing the apprentice

they didn’t believe me </s>', '<s> and i said it four times </s>', '<s> they didn’t believe me </s>', '<s> nobody believed that i was going to run </s>', '<s> nobody </s>', '<s> my wife didn’t even believe me but now she does </s>', '<s> but she actually said if you actually say you’re going to run you’re going to do great because people like you </s>', '<s> she actually said they’d love you but i don’t want to brag </s>', '<s> but she said if you actually run – not you may run you may not run who knows </s>', '<s> but she said if you actually say - so the nbc guys come up – terrific people </s>', '<s> i mean honestly i had a great relationship with nbc for 12 years </s>', '<s> we had many many you know number ones and the apprentice continues to do great </s>', '<s> you know last season you know how well it did </s>', '<s> so they wanted to renew it for many many shows </s>', '<s> in fact mark burnett called up </s>', '<s> you know mark burnett </s>', '<s> he did survivor apprentice </s>', '<s> so mark burnett who’s a great guy he calls up and he goes i don’t believe it </s>', '<s> you’re not taking a renewal </s>', '<s> the word is renewal </s>', '<s> i said that’s right mark </s>', '<s> i’m going to run for president </s>', '<s> no no no you have to – nobody doesn’t take a renewal </s>', '<s> it’s unheard of in primetime television </s>', '<s> two hours primetime </s>',

country </s>', '<s> so anyways the bottom line nbc renewed it </s>', '<s> i told them i’m not doing it and then they finally believed me when i actually announced </s>', '<s> they don’t like me anymore </s>', '<s> it’s amazing </s>', '<s> they do not like me </s>', '<s> but it’s too bad </s>', '<s> too bad </s>', '<s> well thank you </s>', '<s> you know the funny thing about the apprentice – there have been 15 copies of the apprentice </s>', '<s> every single one of them failed </s>', '<s> so then a reporter said to me why do you think that is </s>', '<s> i said because i’m special </s>', '<s> and i was kidding </s>', '<s> i was doing it sarcastically – i mean i sort of meant it to be honest right </s>', '<s> but i was sort of kidding </s>', '<s> and they wrote it and i hated the way

brain great success built a great company do the apprentice tremendous success </s>', '<s> when i did the apprentice a certain critic said it will never be successful because you know to have a big
